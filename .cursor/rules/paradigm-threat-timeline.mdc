# paradigm-threat-timeline: AI Instructions

## Guiding Principles

- **Victors write the history.** The timeline assumes mainstream chronology (Scaligerian) may reflect the perspective of those who controlled record-keeping, not objective fact.
- **Mass-redaction is plausible.** Major world wars, plagues, regime changes, and church chronologists could have altered or destroyed records at any point. Absence of a source does not mean it never existed.
- **Investigation, not adjudication.** Document claims, trace sources, and stay open to alternate chronologies (Fomenko, Saturnian, Phantom Time, indigenous). Do not dismiss a date because mainstream scholarship disagrees.

## Maintaining the Timeline

### Adding Dates

- Add **all relevant dates** we can find for each event.
- Each event's `dates[]` array can have **multiple entries** for different chronology systems:
  ```json
  "dates": [
    { "start": -3147, "end": -687, "calendar": "BCE", "source": "Saturnian/Jno Cook" },
    { "value": -3760, "calendar": "BCE", "source": "Judaic" },
    { "value": -4004, "calendar": "BCE", "source": "Ussher/Masoretic" }
  ]
  ```
- Use `source` and `note` to document where each date comes from and any shift rationale (e.g. phantom time +1000 years).

### Alternate Chronology Systems

When adding or updating events, attempt to calculate or research dates for:

- **Saturnian / Jno Cook** — 4077 BCE creation baseline
- **Fomenko New Chronology** — CE events often shifted; Christ 1152 CE, Crusades = Trojan War
- **Scaligerian (mainstream)** — conventional textbook dates
- **Phantom Time (Illig)** — ~300 years may not have occurred
- **Byzantine / Alexandrian** — 5508–5493 BCE creation
- **Judaic** — 3761 BCE creation
- **Indigenous** — Quiche Maya, Popol Vuh, etc.

### Fomenko Duplicates

- Add `duplicate_of` when an event is a Fomenko-identified duplicate of another.
- Add `related_events` for linked or parallel events across chronologies.
- Use `note` in dates to explain shifts (e.g. "Fomenko: same as evt-1185-crucifixion, 1053-year phantom").

## Investigations

- `investigations/` holds research to validate or trace claims. See `investigations/README.md`.
- When a source cannot be found online or in mainstream refs: assume redaction or gatekeeping before assuming error. Document the gap and add to `docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md`.
- Add speculative conclusions to `docs/CONCLUSIONS.md` when evidence supports them; mark confidence level.

## Scripts (run after edits)

```bash
npm run normalize-events   # Assign dates, rename files
npm run refactor-sections  # Assign sections, collapse timeline_sources
npm run validate-events    # Schema + title/header match
npm run generate-index     # Pre-commit
```

## File Conventions

- Event markdown: `events/{bce|ce}-{year}-{slug}.md`
- Title must exactly match first `#` header in the markdown.
- Sections: BCE Option A (before-creation, golden-age, dark-ages, iron-age-blip) + CE centuries.
