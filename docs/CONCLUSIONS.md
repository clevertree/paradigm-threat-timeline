# Conclusions

Speculations and conclusions ascertained from the Alternate Earth History Timeline. These are synthesised from Saturnian Cosmology, Fomenko's New Chronology, the MudFlood hypothesis, and related sources.

## Golden Age and Atlantis

- **Plato and Atlantis**: Plato and other ancient sources make clear that humans lived on the island of Avalon—identified with Atlantis—during the Golden Age. This island was located at the destination of the Pillars of Heracles and was "larger than Libya and Asia together."
- **Atlantis = Mars**: In Saturnian Cosmology, Atlantis corresponds to the planet Mars as it appeared in the collinear configuration—the highest point one could reach, the North Pole of Mars. It was the center of knowledge in its time.
- **Breakaway civilization**: When the Golden Age ended and Atlantis (Mars) fell from the configuration, humans on Mars became a breakaway civilization. Cut off from Earth, they developed advanced technology in isolation and later sought to reassert influence through religion, "playing God" via cathodic visions and simulated deity worship.

## Phantom Time and Chronology

- **Year Zero = 1053 C.E.**: Fomenko's New Chronology identifies 1053 C.E. as the fabricated "Year Zero"—the same year as 670 B.C.E. (end of cataclysms). The ~1700-year period between them was invented by the Holy Roman Empire.
- **Scaligerian fabrication**: Joseph Scaliger and church chronologists inserted phantom centuries into the timeline, duplicating events with names and locations changed. Modern history began less than a thousand years ago.

## MudFlood and the 18th Century

- **Pugachev Rebellion trigger**: The MudFlood Energetic Event was triggered by the need to defeat the Pugachev Rebellion (1773–1774). Pugachev was Peter III, descendant of Christ, leading giants and smaller humans against the Romanov dynasty.
- **Mars-directed energy weapons**: The MudFlood was caused by large-scale Directed Energy Weapons on Mars, fired at Earth during opposition. The secondary discharge backfired, devastating Martian surface cities.
- **1775 Rus-Horde breakup**: The defeat of Pugachev led to the dissolution of the Rus-Horde (Tartarian) Empire. Siberia was laid waste; Tartary was erased from maps.

## Pyramids and Exodus

- **Pyramids as quantum gates**: Pyramids were built at electromagnetic ley-line intersections, functioning as quantum tunnels between Earth and Mars. They enabled the Pyramidal Empire's communication and control.
- **Exodus 1492 B.C.E.**: The "Passover" of Comet Venus and the collapse of the Pyramidal Empire—Earth left Jupiter's orbit, pyramids ceased to function, and the gate network fell. The Old Testament Exodus narrative redacts this event.
- **1492 C.E. mirror**: The Apocalypse Crusade was deliberately dated 1492 C.E. by the Deep State to mirror and reverse the losses of the Exodus.

## Deep State and Control

- **Deep State origin**: The Deep State emerged from the priest class of Atlantis who preserved knowledge after the Golden Age fell, embedding themselves in human bureaucracy and establishing monotheistic control.
- **Latin as control**: Conversion of holy texts and indigenous knowledge to Latin—and later to vernacular—caused mass illiteracy. Latin remains the "matrix code" for decrypting Western literature.
- **Rex Bellator**: Military religious orders were unified under a single plan. The Deep State directed both sides of major wars, benefiting from predictable outcomes.

## Giants and Genocide

- **Giants defeated at Kulikovo (1380)**: The Battle of Kulikovo saw giants of the Horde defeated by cannon technology. "Royal" Christianity gave way to Apostolic Christianity (Canonization).
- **Smithsonian cover-up**: Giant skeletons were systematically destroyed or recategorized as "dinosaur" fossils. Native Americans were reframed as primitive to justify colonialism.
