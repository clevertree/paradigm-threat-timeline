# Animation Tracker

Plan and track animated visualizations of the Paradigm Threat Timeline.

## Overview

This document tracks the development of animated timeline visualizations:
- **Map-based animations** (11th–21st century CE): Rus-Horde empire expansion, wars, religious conflicts
- **3D planetary animations** (BC / Golden Age): Saturnian collinear configuration, planetary changes
- **Pre-render pipeline**: Kdenlive assembly for full-featured video export
- **Web browser rendering**: Lightweight interactive visualization

## Part 1: Map-Based Animation (11th–21st Century CE)

### 1.1 Empire Timeline (Fomenko's Rus-Horde Model)

According to Fomenko, a single Rus-Horde (Tartarian) empire controlled most of Eurasia before fragmenting. Track territorial changes by century:

|---------|--------------|-------------------------|------------|
| 11th | No empires/borders | Pre-formation | Common Era begins (1053 CE shift) |
| 12th | Proto-empire forming | Early Horde | Birth of Christianity; historical Christ (1152–1185) |
| 13th | Rus-Horde expansion | Mongol-Tartary, Great Tartary | Historical Christ dies (1185); empire consolidates |
| 14th | Peak expansion | Great Tartary, Mongol Empire, Cathay | Mongol conquest = Rus-Horde expansion |
| 15th | Regional fragmentation begins | Ottoman (= Ataman), Spain (= Horde colony), Habsburg | Ottoman conquest of Europe; 1492 apocalypse crusade |
| 16th | Religious schism | Protestant vs Orthodox regions | Reformation; Inquisition attacks Horde remnants |
| 17th | Romanovs rise | Muscovy separates from Horde | 1666 apocalypse; British Empire as instrument |
| 18th | Final collapse | Tartary vs Romanovs | Mudflood; Pugachev rebellion (1775); maps redrawn |

## Part 4: Software and Rendering Options

### 4.1 Web Browser Rendering (Lightweight)

For interactive web display with minimal hardware requirements:

| Software | Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|------|----------|
| **Leaflet.js** | 2D map library | Lightweight, tile-based, easy timeline sliders | No 3D, limited animation | Map timeline slider |
| **D3.js** | Data visualization | Flexible, SVG-based, good transitions | Steeper learning curve | Complex data overlays |
| **MapLibre GL** | Vector maps | Hardware accelerated, 3D terrain | More complex setup | Modern map rendering |
| **Three.js** | 3D WebGL | Full 3D capability, planetary rendering | Higher hardware needs | Saturnian cosmology scenes |
| **Babylon.js** | 3D engine | Game-quality 3D, physics engine | Heavier than Three.js | Complex 3D animations |
| **p5.js** | Creative coding | Easy animations, beginner friendly | Less performant for maps | Simple demonstrations |
| **PixiJS** | 2D WebGL | Fast sprite rendering | Not for maps specifically | UI overlays |
| **Anime.js** | Animation | Smooth transitions, lightweight | Needs underlying renderer | Timeline scrubbing |

**Recommended Stack for Web:**
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js + D3.js overlays + Anime.js for transitions
- **3D Planetary**: Three.js (lighter) or Babylon.js (more features)
- **Timeline control**: Custom slider or vis-timeline

### 4.2 Pre-Render Pipeline (Kdenlive)

For full-featured video export:

| Stage | Software | Purpose | Output Format |
|-------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Map animation** | QGIS + TimeManager plugin | GIS-accurate map sequence | PNG sequence |
| **Map animation alt** | Blender (Grease Pencil + compositor) | Artistic map animation | PNG/EXR sequence |
| **3D planetary** | Blender | Saturnian configuration renders | PNG/EXR sequence |
| **3D planetary alt** | Houdini (if available) | Complex particle/plasma effects | EXR sequence |
| **Compositing** | Blender compositor or Natron | Layer sequences | PNG/EXR sequence |
| **Assembly** | Kdenlive | Final video assembly | MP4/WebM |
| **Audio** | Audacity or Kdenlive | Narration, music | WAV/FLAC |

**Pre-render Workflow:**

```
1. QGIS/Blender: Generate map frame sequences (11th→21st century)
     └─> /export/frames/maps/frame_0001.png to frame_XXXX.png

2. Blender: Generate 3D planetary sequences (BC era)
     └─> /export/frames/planets/frame_0001.png to frame_XXXX.png

3. Blender Compositor: Composite overlays, labels, transitions
     └─> /export/frames/composite/frame_0001.png to frame_XXXX.png

4. Kdenlive: Import sequences, add audio, export final video
     └─> /export/timeline-animation.mp4
```

### 4.3 Blender 3D Requirements for Saturnian Cosmology

| Feature | Technique | Complexity |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Planetary spheres | UV spheres with procedural textures | Medium |
| Saturn glow (pre-ring) | Volumetric emission shader | Medium |
| Venus plasmoid | Procedural star shape + emission | High |
| Plasma streamers | Geometry nodes or particles | High |
| Absu layers | Nested volumetric spheres | High |
| Electrical discharges | Particle system + curves | High |

2. **Historical layers** (time-enabled):
   - Empire boundaries (11th–21st century)
   - City locations
   - Battle sites
   - Religious zones
3. **TimeManager plugin**: Animate through dates
4. **Export**: Frame sequence at each date step

### 4.5 Software Summary

| Requirement | Web (Simple) | Pre-render (Full) |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Map animation | Leaflet + D3 | QGIS + Blender |
| 3D planets | Three.js | Blender |
| Timeline control | Custom JS | Kdenlive |
| Final output | Interactive HTML | MP4 video |
