# Outstanding Questions

Unresolved questions, contradictions, and clarifications needed for the Alternate Earth History Timeline.

## Unresolved Questions

- **Phantom time boundaries**: Illig's Phantom Time (297 years, ~AD 614–911) vs Fomenko's ~1053-year shift. How do these interact? Which fabrication applies where?
- **Carbon-14 spike 774 CE**: Tree rings date to 774 CE; alternate interpretation places it at 1063 B.C.E. or 1774. Which dating system should the timeline display?
- **Creation dates**: Multiple conflicting creation dates (5969–3491 B.C.). How to present these without implying a single "correct" one?
- **Requerimiento 1513**: Possibly pushed back ~150 years by historic redactors. Need source verification.
- **Joan of Arc naming**: "Maid of Orleans" called "Joan of Arc" only from second half of 16th century. What was she called before?

## Contradictions

- **Scaligerian vs Fomenko**: Mainstream history places Christ ~4 BC in Palestine; Fomenko places Christ 1152 AD in Crimea. Timeline must display both.
- **Rus-Horde breakup**: Fomenko says 1775; Scaligerian history has different narrative. Correlate or separate?
- **Trojan War = Crusades**: Fomenko claims these are the same event. Need duplicate linking.
- **Exodus 1492 B.C.E. vs 1492 C.E. Apocalypse Crusade**: Same date, different epochs. Intentional mirroring?

## Clarifications Needed

- **Source citations**: Many events lack explicit citations. Add where possible.
- **Priority assignment**: Events with `dates: []` (context sections) need rules for timeline placement.
- **Media array**: When to populate `media` vs rely on images embedded in markdown?
- **Scan paradigm-threat-files**: Governance, influence, events, science folders not yet fully extracted. Systematic scan needed.
