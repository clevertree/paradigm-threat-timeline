# Outstanding Questions

Unresolved questions, contradictions, and clarifications needed for the Alternate Earth History Timeline.

## Unresolved Questions

- **Phantom time boundaries**: Illig's Phantom Time (297 years, ~AD 614–911) vs Fomenko's ~1053-year shift. How do these interact? Which fabrication applies where?
- **Carbon-14 spike 774 CE**: Tree rings date to 774 CE; alternate interpretation places it at 1063 B.C.E. or 1774. Which dating system should the timeline display?
- **Creation dates**: Multiple conflicting creation dates (5969–3491 B.C.). How to present these without implying a single "correct" one?
- **Requerimiento 1513**: Possibly pushed back ~150 years by historic redactors. Need source verification.
- **Joan of Arc naming**: "Maid of Orleans" called "Joan of Arc" only from second half of 16th century. What was she called before?

## Contradictions

- **Scaligerian vs Fomenko**: Mainstream history places Christ ~4 BC in Palestine; Fomenko places Christ 1152 AD in Crimea. Timeline must display both.
- **Rus-Horde breakup**: Fomenko says 1775; Scaligerian history has different narrative. Correlate or separate?
- **Trojan War = Crusades**: Fomenko claims these are the same event. Need duplicate linking.
- **Exodus 1492 B.C.E. vs 1492 C.E. Apocalypse Crusade**: Same date, different epochs. Intentional mirroring?

## Clarifications Needed

- **Source citations**: Many events lack explicit citations. Add where possible.
- **Priority assignment**: Events with `dates: []` (context sections) need rules for timeline placement.
- **Media array**: When to populate `media` vs rely on images embedded in markdown?
- **Scan paradigm-threat-files**: Governance, influence, events, science folders not yet fully extracted. Systematic scan needed.

## Newly Logged (to resolve)

- **Atlantean city names — Og, Aryan, Poseida**: None of these three names appear in Plato or any ancient primary
  source as Atlantean city names. Current sourcing: *Og* — ancient (Og of Bashan, biblical/Talmudic, Book of Giants)
  but as a person/king, not a city; *Aryan* — Blavatsky's *Secret Doctrine* (1888) as a post-Atlantean root race name,
  not a city; *Poseida* — Edgar Cayce readings (1923–1944, "Poseidia") and James Tyberonn Earth-Keeper channelings
  (2000s). Investigate: (1) Is there any pre-Cayce source naming these as Atlantean cities? (2) Could Cayce's Poseidia
  derive from Classical sources (Poseidon-cult place names) via redacted intermediaries? (3) Are there ancient place
  names in the Arctic/Greenland/Nordic region that phonetically match Og, Aryan, or Poseida?

## The Blip — Calendar Reset Mechanism (Open Theory)

The following questions are **unresolved** and constitute the core of the ongoing Blip theory.
No catastrophist source in the archive addresses them directly. Absence of a source is noted;
this does not mean the claims are false.

- **Why did the calendar reset to Year Zero?** No local political event (including the Crucifixion)
  has ever been sufficient justification for a global retroactive reversal of a counting system. The
  only adequate cause would be a physical event ending one cosmic era and beginning another — the
  final stabilization of Earth's orbit at 365.25 days (~684 BCE, Cook's Phaethon event). This
  connection is not made by any source in the archive. It is original to this investigation.

- **Why does the BC count run backward?** The reverse counting direction of BC implies that an
  observer at Year Zero projected the prior catastrophic era *behind* themselves. This is consistent
  with a culture that knew the old sky was gone and wished to measure the distance back to it. No
  source explains the backward direction as anything other than a construction convention. The
  physical interpretation — that the orbital stability event creates a genuine "before/after" divide
  separating the catastrophic era from the stable era — is unconfirmed.

- **The depth of the Blip under a Young Earth model**: If the Earth is only a few thousand years
  old (consistent with Saturnian Cosmology's 4077 BCE creation date) and if the pre-Year-Zero count
  is a fabrication or retroactive extension, how many of the BC years are real? The Scaligerian
  count reaches back ~5,000 years BC from Year Zero. Under a strict Young Earth / Short Cosmic Life
  Cycle reading, the backward-counted BC era may itself encode a compressed or invented chronology.
  This depth variable is unquantified.

- **Source gap**: Dionysius Exiguus (AD 532) introduced the Anno Domini forward count. The BC
  retroactive count was standardized by Bede (~AD 731) and not universally adopted until the 17th
  century. Neither Dionysius nor Bede explains *why* Year Zero was chosen as the reset point other
  than the theological claim of the Incarnation. The theological justification may be a cover for a
  now-forgotten astronomical rationale. This is unverified.

## Jerusalem Architecture — Mars/Atlantis or Saturn's Hexagon? (Open Theory)

The historical Jerusalem at Istanbul (Yoros/Troy/Tsar-Grad) was built with **3 walls, each with 6 gates
(= 666)**. Article 05.03.00 attributes this pattern to Saturn's hexagonal polar storm (visible during
the Golden Age collinear configuration). Article 02.07.00 establishes that Atlantis — the First
Jerusalem — sat on the north pole of Mars with concentric rings of land and water (*Critias* 113e–114a).

**Unresolved**: Did the builders of Jerusalem at Istanbul consciously replicate the concentric-ring
geometry of *Atlantis on Mars*, or Saturn's hexagonal boundary, or a combined memory from holy texts
that merged both? No Saturnian Cosmology source explicitly connects the 3-wall/6-gate architecture
to Plato's Atlantis layout. The connection is inferential:

- Saturn's hexagon provides 6-fold symmetry
- Atlantis's concentric rings (Mars north polar cap) provide the walled-enclosure template
- Both were simultaneously visible during the Golden Age
- The Deep State priest class originated in Atlantis and would have carried both memories
- David Talbott (originsofmyth.txt): the creation myth's subject was "the construction of a celestial
  dwelling — a cosmic city, temple, or kingdom — revered as the prototype of sacred space"

**The control argument**: By the 11th century, ordinary people had moved to Sun worship and the
"Good Word" (gospel) — the message that they no longer needed priests. The only group that would
rebuild a replica of the Atlantean celestial city on Earth was a priestly class whose authority
depended on it. The Crucifixion at this same site later confirmed its function as a political
control centre rather than a genuine holy city. This interpretation is original to this investigation
and remains unconfirmed by any source in the archive.
