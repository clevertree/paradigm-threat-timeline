# Image Generation Prompt Template

Use this file as context when asking an AI image generator or multimodal agent to produce illustrated HD timeline images.
Fill in the `[PLACEHOLDERS]` before submitting.

## Agent Background

You are illustrating scenes from an **Alternate Earth History timeline** based on Saturnian Cosmology, Fomenko's New Chronology, and catastrophist sources. This is **not** mainstream history. Assume the consensus timeline has been falsified by record-keepers after cataclysms.

The timeline covers real catastrophic events in Earth's ancient past. Images should feel like **documentary concept art** — dramatic, photorealistic or painterly, wide cinematic format.

---

## Image Specification

- **Format**: HD Desktop Wallpaper, landscape, 16:9 aspect ratio (1920×1080 minimum, prefer 2560×1440)
- **Composition**: Cinematic wide shot with a primary scene in the foreground and the correct sky configuration in the background
- **Date Annotation**: Display the date prominently in the image as a **stone-carved or plasma-etched inscription** in the lower-left or lower-right corner — e.g. `670 BCE` or `1053 CE` — as if etched into rock or glowing with plasma energy. It should be legible but feel like part of the scene, not a UI label.
- **Style**: Epic historical concept art. Detailed, dramatic lighting. No modern elements unless explicitly requested.

## Sky Rules by Era (CRITICAL — do not deviate)

### BCE / Golden Age (any date before 670 BCE)

The sky shows the **Northern Hemisphere Configuration** (Wheel of Heaven):
- **Saturn** is the central body — appears as a **sunlike glowing sphere with no distinct ring system**. Show a plasma halo (Absu) or spoked wheel / Shamash-style motif around it instead of rings.
- **Venus** appears as a **single luminous plasmoid star figure** — a 6- or 8-pointed plasma star shape, bright and electric, directly below or in front of Saturn along the polar axis.
- **Mars** appears as a **solid sphere**, distinct and spherical, in the polar alignment stack above Venus.
- The overall arrangement forms the **Tree of Life** / polar column: Saturn → Venus → Mars stacked along the magnetic axis.
- Sky colors: deep violet-blue overhead transitioning to hazy amber-orange near the horizon.
- **Do NOT show Saturn with a ring system. Do NOT show multiple stars or other symbols.**

Southern Hemisphere viewers instead see petroglyph-like figures in a purple plasma sky:
- Uranus, Neptune, Mercury form the **squatting-man** (Kokopelli) petroglyph figure glowing in the sky.
- Sky is purple-tinged with luminous white plasma squatting-man, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic figures — as if ancient rock art were projected as celestial light.

### Dark Ages (670 BCE – 1053 CE / The Blip)

The Wheel of Heaven is **gone**. Saturn no longer dominates the sky.
- Show **Venus and Mars tethered together** as the comet-dragon — Venus as a blazing comet head, Mars as a red orb trailing behind it.
- Sky is more chaotic: dust veils, auroral streamers, a red-tinted or dusty atmosphere.
- **No polar wheel, no Saturnian configuration.**

### Common Era (after 1053 CE)

- Normal night sky — stars, Moon, Sun in familiar configuration.
- Sky can show comets, meteors, eclipses, or visible planets depending on the event.
- Atmosphere can be stormy, volcanic-hazy, or clear depending on the event.

## Event to Illustrate

**Date:** `[DATE IN BCE/CE — e.g. "670 BCE" or "1053 CE"]`

**Event Title:** `[EVENT TITLE]`

**Scene Description:**
`[1–3 sentences describing what is happening in the foreground — who, what action, what landscape]`

**Mood / Tone:** `[e.g. "cataclysmic and awe-inspiring", "quiet and ceremonial", "apocalyptic", "triumphant"]`

**Foreground Elements:**
- `[Element 1 — e.g. "ancient stone observers on a hilltop looking upward"]`
- `[Element 2 — e.g. "a comet or plasma bolt striking the horizon"]`
- `[Element 3 — optional]`

**Additional Notes:** `[Any specific iconography, culture (Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Norse, Slavic, etc.), architecture, or details to include]`

## Example Filled Prompt

**Date:** `670 BCE`

**Event Title:** Iron Age Begins — Priori-Mars Loses Its Outer Shell

**Scene Description:**
An ancient observer stands on a stone platform in a barren highland landscape, looking up at a sky in chaos. A massive red sphere (Mars) is shedding a glowing plasma shell, the debris raining toward the horizon as streaks of white light. Venus pulses as a radiant electric star below a dimming Saturn.

**Mood / Tone:** Apocalyptic and awe-inspiring. The end of an age.

**Foreground Elements:**
- Ancient stone platform or altar, solitary robed figure with arms raised
- Raining plasma debris and glowing ejecta across the horizon
- Cracked, scorched ground in the immediate foreground

**Additional Notes:** Mesopotamian aesthetic. Show the date `670 BCE` etched into the stone platform edge in glowing plasma script. Warm amber and red palette for lower sky, deep violet above.

## Output Instructions

Generate **one** HD landscape image (2560×1440 preferred). The date must appear in the image — etched, burned, glowing, or carved — not as a caption. Include the event title as a secondary inscription if composition allows.
