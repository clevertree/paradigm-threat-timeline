# 684 to 670 B.C.E. Solar System becomes stable

By 670 B.C.E., the Earth's orbit becomes circular and the period of *creation* that formed the planets of our Solar
System comes to an end. Earth's new orbit and season schedule would be pleasantly predictable. In religious text, the
*one* God (our Sun) *drives out the many* (other planets) to rule over a new age. Once again, Deep State Monotheism
would lose ground with the general populations as no priest could have predicted this event. Free of their control, the
general population forms [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Persian_origins_or_influences) around the
concept of **knowing** - in contrast with the *encrypted secrecy* of Deep State religions. The gnostic evangelists would
be known for spreading the [Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gospel) meaning **"good news"**. What was the good
news? The new Sun God was of a very different nature from the old Creator God Saturn. The Sun provides endless abundance
without asking for anything in return. The Sun reveals dark places and old secrets. The Sun would never die. The
good news was that from now on - the world would remain free - as nobody could claim the authority of the Sun!

#### The length of a year jumps by 1/4th of. a rotation to 365.25 days

The *year's length* would no longer undergo significant changes as Earth's orbital period
would remain constant in the future. This allowed for the formation of the first
[fixed lunisolar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar).
One problem to solve in the *fixed* calendar is how to count the number of years 'since *creation*'. As the
length of the year changed many times, date ranges that span events during *creation* are inherently _inconsistent_.
Therefore, the solution to this problem is to assign a label to each date indicating whether the year occurred *before*
the Common Era **(B.C.E.)**, or *afterward* during the Common Era **(C.E.)**.

#### How many Lunar Months are in a Year?

1 month was the period of 28 days of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, and back then there were *13 months* of 28
days in a year with the addition of one leap day. Over time, the period of Earth's orbit around the Sun changed
slightly, causing less than 13 lunar months to occur 63 years per century. This caused a conflict in religious ceremonies
where some holidays would be skipped in some years, leading to the number 13 being
considered [unlucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_\(number\)#Bad).

The Deep State, which was seeking to control this
new Astrological religion, took advantage of the calendar conflict by inventing the Zodiac and 12 month
Roman/Julian/Gregorian Calendar. This gave the Deep State churches authority over religious ceremony, farming, and even
governance/warfare. The Deep State leveraged their new Zodiac religion as a buffer between the old testament secrets they wished to
keep, and the religious texts propagated to the masses. The life stories they published in the modern bible about the
*resurrected Jesus Christ* are all redactions of
[stories](https://solarmythology.com/lessons/christ2002.htm) based on the Sun and seasons on a 12-month calendar.
Similarly, the stories published in the OT about King David
are [also redactions](https://www.usbible.com/Astrology/stars_of_david.htm) based on the 12 Zodiac signs.

## The Blip: 7th Century B.C.E. to 10th Century C.E. Never Occurred

B.C.E. 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are actually the same year. After the cataclysms ended, the Deep State jealousy
guarded records in *holy* church vaults, forbidding outsiders from viewing them. As the old *gods* and stories were
forgotten or fell into myth, it became easier for the Deep State to falsify the timeline. As a result of the success of
the Anno Domini Calendar conspiracy, humans today
(including [catastrophist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) authors
like [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://www.velikovsky.info/) and [Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/))
believe the events of *creation* ended over 2700 years ago.

In the model of catastrophism the date of the *end of ancient history* is the same date as the
last cataclysmic event - 670 B.C.E when the final orbit of 365.25 days was reached, and the same date as
the *beginning of modern history* - 1053 C.E. In other words, the age of cataclysm
**ended just under 1000 years ago**.
