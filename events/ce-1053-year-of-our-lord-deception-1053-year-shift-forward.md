# 'Year of our Lord' Deception - 1053 Year Shift forward

With the start of the Common Era, chronologists would write the phrase
[In the year of our Lord](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in%20the%20year%20of%20our%20Lord) before
each date. This meant a date which was occurring in C.E. times after the Lord (our Sun) appeared and after the start of
the *fixed* calendar. Writing the name of the Lord was forbidden and often only the letter <code>ι</code> was used
in place of the whole phrase. Later, in the 16th century the [Jesuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits) would
reinterpret the letter <code>ι</code> as a digit in the 1000th place. This redaction *shifted the calendar* 1053
years forward in time. They also interpreted *The Lord* as referring to *Jesus Christ*. This led to the erroneous
assumption that the historical Christ must have been born (or even died) around 0 AD.
