# Signs of civilization on the surface of Mars

The cities on Mars cannot be seen from Earth telescopes but natural canals, lakes, and oceans can be seen
as darker regions that change shape throughout the year.
Modern scientists attempt to [debunk](https://cosmicpursuits.com/2183/cosmos/mars-observing-guide/)
this observable phenomenon by insisting the regions appear to change as a result of 'dust clouds'.
But what about the artificial-looking canals observed by Lowell?

The Deep State may have planned to emerge into the public and reveal its presence on Earth and Mars
if it had won any of the last 3 World Wars, but it lost all of them and was never able to rule the entire world at once.
Its existence had to remain hidden (i.e. deep), but poisoning Lowell wouldn't be enough.
In order to prevent life on Mars from being discovered, The Deep State had to prevent Lowell's observations
from being repeated by others.
If the cities and other ["non-natural features"](https://www.cosmos/marsanomalyresearch.com/) were observable on Mars,
the jig would be up. Cities and canals would all have to be [erased](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23184799).
All the Humans who lived in these cities would have to return to the inner realms.
Those who refused would have to be convinced.
