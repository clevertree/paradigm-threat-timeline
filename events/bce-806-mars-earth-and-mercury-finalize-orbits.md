# Mars, Earth and Mercury finalize orbits.

Although the orbits of Earth and Mars were apparently stable, the magnetospheres of each planet would occasionally
overlap the orbits. As planets came into proximity, large-scale electric discharge would occur between them increasing
the orbital gap and further altering their orbital periods. With each encounter, calendars would have to be adjusted to
accommodate for the change in the length of a year. Over the next 119 years, Earth would experience 9 encounters with
Mars resulting in planet-wide lightning storms. During these deadly storms, the Earth's surface acted as
a [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode)
absorbing a constant stream of energy from the anodal surface of Mars. Electric current flowed through Earth making
caves unreliable sanctuaries. This prompted humans to learn how to harness electricity in a bid to survive the storms.

Contemplating the nature
of [electromagnetic induction](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnetic-induction.html),
humans built the first cathedrals and minarets. This hollow spire design
routed [electric current](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/basic_concepts/current/what-is-electrical-current.php)
around the structure preventing heat to build into electrostatic discharge thus protecting its inhabitants.
_All cathedrals originally provided sanctuary from interplanetary lightning storms._
The rapid onset of technological invention provided by Mars would be remembered in the myth of Prometheus.
[Ackerman](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/ackerman/ackerman-mythology_greek.html#prometheus)
describes the Greek myth:


> Prometheus [was punished] for thwarting the initial effort of Zeus
> to [introduce Pandora](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pandora-Greek-mythology)
> into the world and for his role in instructing
> mortals in the use of fire, thereby aiding in the development
> of civilization, which the gods generally discouraged. Prometheus
> was bound to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains with unbreakable
> chains, where a vulture tore at his flesh all day, with no rest,
> no sleep and no respite.
