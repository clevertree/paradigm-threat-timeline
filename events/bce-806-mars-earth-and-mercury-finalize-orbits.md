# 806 to 687 B.C.E. Mars, Earth and Mercury finalize orbits.

Although the orbits of Earth and Mars were apparently stable, the magnetospheres of each planet would occasionally
overlap the orbits. As planets came into proximity, large-scale electric discharge would occur between them increasing
the orbital gap and further altering their orbital periods. With each encounter, calendars would have to be adjusted to
accommodate for the change in the length of a year. Over the next 119 years, Earth would experience 9 encounters with
Mars resulting in planet-wide lightning storms. During these deadly storms, the Earth's surface acted as
a [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode)
absorbing a constant stream of energy from the anodal surface of Mars. Electric current flowed through Earth making
caves unreliable sanctuaries. This prompted humans to learn how to harness electricity in a bid to survive the storms.

Contemplating the nature
of [electromagnetic induction](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnetic-induction.html),
humans built the first cathedrals and minarets. This hollow spire design
routed [electric current](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/basic_concepts/current/what-is-electrical-current.php)
around the structure preventing heat to build into electrostatic discharge thus protecting its inhabitants.
_All cathedrals originally provided sanctuary from interplanetary lightning storms._
The rapid onset of technological invention provided by Mars would be remembered in the myth of Prometheus.
[Ackerman](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/ackerman/ackerman-mythology_greek.html#prometheus)
describes the Greek myth:


> Prometheus [was punished] for thwarting the initial effort of Zeus
> to [introduce Pandora](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pandora-Greek-mythology)
> into the world and for his role in instructing
> mortals in the use of fire, thereby aiding in the development
> of civilization, which the gods generally discouraged. Prometheus
> was bound to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains with unbreakable
> chains, where a vulture tore at his flesh all day, with no rest,
> no sleep and no respite.

#### Mars (aka Prometheus) replaces Venus as the new Saviour

In the [Greek narrative](https://www.ancient.eu/Prometheus/), Prometheus (Mars) thwarted Zeus's plan by forcing humans
to invent technology too early.
[Pandora's Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box#Difficulties_of_interpretation)
is metaphor for the **Deep State** plan to _rule earth through evil_, or more specifically through the strategic release
of suppressed technology, usury practice, religious mind control, greed, envy, hatred, pain, disease, hunger, poverty,
governance/war, and death. The electric encounters with Mars quickly teach humans how to harness electricity, as well as generate
their own. In the 7th century B.C.E., humanity enjoyed a lasting period of free energy, ideal health, and no Deep
State influence as [magnificent cities](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-best-ancient-cities/index.html)
blossomed across the planet. The conflict between Mars and Jupiter showed yet again that the Deep State did not
represent their influence. The plan to rule humanity through evil would have to be stashed back in Pandora's Box to be
released at a later date.

Humanity knew this gift had come at a cost. With each encounter, the outer shell
of [Priori-Mars](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/2010/01/16/the-origin-of-avatar/)
collapsed making the inner shell temporarily visible. The [lightning scars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1e5_tB6Y)
streaking across the surface of the inner shell of Mars lead humans to believe Prometheus is being punished for his gift
to humanity. Nine times they watch as his 'flesh' was torn apart and sewn back together only to be torn apart again
later. On February 27 747 B.C.E., Mars bumps Earth's magnetosphere and once again alters the Earth's orbital duration.
Calendar keepers introduce a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) (every 4 years) to account for the new
6-hour offset.
