# Martians are Humans

After the MFEE devastated the Mars ecosystem, birth-rates would have plummeted across the planet as a result.
This is likely why we see so much predictive programming suggesting that Mars 'needs' women.
Therefore, it is very unlikely that any race or species other than humans (appearing like you and me)
inhabit Mars. If Martian humans actually had a different appearance from Earth humans, 'Deep State' style
infiltration schemes would be impossible to pull off.
In modern times, breeding on Earth became strictly controlled under "Marital" Wedlock.
Saturnian Cosmology reminds us that humans existed on Mars in the Golden Age.


![### Martians speak Latin

Why else would
a [dead language](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/fact-vs-fiction-is-latin-a-dead-language)
still be taught in schools around the world?
Why else would the [official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin)
of the Vatican City Holy See also be the same language *all* of our Laws and Science, Medicine, and Theology Books are
written in?
Latin is still very much alive and taught to us so we can interface with our
[Latin-speaking masters](https://books.google.com/books?id=v3TDEDfEPdEC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=martians+speak+latin)
both here and on Mars.
