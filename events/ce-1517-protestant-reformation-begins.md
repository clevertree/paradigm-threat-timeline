# 1517 C.E. Protestant Reformation Begins

The Europeans who remained behind and survived the slaughter did their best to comply with the Empire's new rules, but
the damage to unification was irreparable. The West would never again trust the East. The Deep State, still running the
Empire, knew that another rebellion was inevitable and sought to encourage and command it using their
own [Controlled Opposition](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/controlled_opposition) project known as the Protestant Reformation. During the
last century, the Deep State took advantage of
the [printing press](https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/printing-press)
to trigger the Apocalypse Crusade. They would use this same powerful propaganda tool to direct the
Reformation. Such writers as [Huldrych Zwingli](https://museeprotestant.org/en/notice/ulrich-zwingli-1484-1531/),
[Martin Luther](https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/martin-luther-and-the-95-theses),
[John Calvin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Calvin) and many others began proliferating letters critical of
the Rus-Empire-and yet *in favor* of Deep State Monotheism. No Protestant works ever criticized the
necessity of the Apocalypse Crusade or questioned the existence of God or the authority of the Church. Instead, they all
focused on criticising innocuous Church practices like [selling indulgences](https://www.luther.de/en/95thesen.html)
while simultaneously promoting long-standing Deep State programming such as the doctrine of
[original sin](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/state-theology-does-sin-deserve-damnation).
[Lutherans teach that](https://www.lightplanet.com/christianity/lutheran.html):

> sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly "good," are not capable of doing works that satisfy
> God's justice. Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and sinful motives. Because of this, all humanity
> deserves **eternal damnation in hell**.
