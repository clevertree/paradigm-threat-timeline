# The "Hundred Years War" begins

As a result of this conquest, many vassal states formed across the planet. Some states were created by peaceful means
and rewarded by retaining their autonomy. Others were forged by warfare, conscription, and taxes. Inevitably
micro-injustices within the Empire caused pockets of resistance, forming the basis
of [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism). The Hordian campaign would drag on in these regions
leading to a war lasting over [a hundred years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War).

*"There were several brothels located in Pompeii — appearing to be part of the Roman culture — that were vastly decorated with pictures representing different sexual similes above the entryways to the cubicles. A fresco from one such brothel depicts a man and woman making love on a bed. The woman is sitting on top of the man with what appears to be a breast band around her chest. Her right arm is outstretched with her hand resting on the bed to the left of his head." [Source](https://vermiliongoldfishartblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/pompeii-pornography-power/)*
