# 1285 C.E. First Olympic Games

In memory of the religious plurality that followed the Crusades the Olympic Games would be held every 4 years throughout
the Empire. Coliseums were built to host the events in western states like France, Italy, Tunisia, and Croatia. They
were never used for gladiator fights which mostly occurred
on [public squares](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC013EN.html) outside the boundaries of imperial law.

## 14th Century C.E.: Great Expansion of the Mongol / Slavic Rus-Horde Empire

By the middle of the 14th century the Russian cavalry began their invasion of Europe, Africa and India, in a
wide-reaching offensive. As a result a considerable part of Eurasia was colonized. Scaligerian Chronology remembers
Rus-Horde as the Etruscans who founded Rome. However, in Russian history, the Horde chose Florence as their new capital.

With the expansion of the Empire came major works of construction. Magnificent

style cathedrals and chambers were built across Western Europe and North America. In Istanbul, the massive Hagia Sophia
was rebuilt symbolizing peace and [syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_syncretism) between religions.
Back home, the Kremlin continued to grow in size and fortifications. In Egypt,
[great cemeteries](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-ap/ancient-egypt-ap/a/old-kingdom-the-great-pyramids-of-giza)
were built close to the ancient pyramids to contain the mummified bodies of the Csar-Khans as well as other high-ranking
officials. This location was ideal for burial as the dry

of the Dead describes the ferrying of bodies across the 'River Styx' i.e. the Mediterranean Sea.
