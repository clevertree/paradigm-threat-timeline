# Percival Lowell Maps Mars in Detail

From 1880 to 1895, [Percival Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell#Canals_of_Mars) studied Mars
extensively at his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and made intricate drawings of canals, oases, cities,
and other "non-natural features".
He described in detail the vast skein of mechanically constructed canal systems that traversed the red planet
unmistakably grown around the Antarctic regions.
Lowell then published his views in three books: Mars (1895),
Mars and Its Canals (1906), and Mars As the Abode of Life (1908).
Percival Lowell states in the New York Times in 1907:

> “It is a direct sequitur from this that the planet is at present the abode of intelligent constructive life,
> I may say in this connection that the theory of such life upon Mars was in no way an
> a-priori hypothesis on my part, but deduced from the outcome of observation,
> and that my observations since have fully confirmed it.
> No other supposition is consonant with all the facts here.”
