# The Holy Inquisition

The empire reacted to reports of ethnic tension and established the *Inquisition Court* to quell the unrest and
investigate the Reformation that was causing it. [Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html):

> The institution of the inquisition was founded in 1542, and it eventually swept over the entire Western Europe. There
> has never been any such institution founded inside the Orthodox Church-it wasn't required.
> We must linger on the frequently disputed “crimes of the inquisition” for a while. We have been fed the version that
> the institution of the inquisition in the Western Europe was characterised by horrendous and strangely senseless
> cruelty – fires whereupon innocent people would be burnt alive are supposed to have blaze all across Europe.
> Simultaneously, there is another point of view on the matter, voiced by a number of West Europeans, according to
> which the inquisition trials weren’t any crueller than the regular courts of that epoch. Moreover – these courts

The court's mission was also the eradication of sodomy, witchcraft, and other "perversions" that allegedly resulted in
the recent 1492 Apocalypse. It also went after belief systems antithetical to the Churches teachings such as Sun worship
or [Copernicanism](https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system). French
poet [Celestin Douais](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html) claimed:

> [the inquisition courts] were created in the interests of the heretics, saving them from pogroms, indiscriminate
> massacres and uncontrollable persecution. The inquisition courts also contributed to the preservation of the epoch’s
> civilisation, helping to maintain order and to curb the propagation of major evils, protecting the century’s interests
> and truly standing guard of social justice and the Christian ideology

*The "burning of the Jews" depiction during Europe's Black Death plague. Source: University of Iowa's Library. When the populace searched for answers, the ecclesiastical hierarchy lectured them on how the Black Death was God's retribution for their wicked ways. In Spain, tolerance of the "killers of Christ" was among them. Soon tales of Jews pouring poisonous powder into wells circulated throughout what is now Germany and France.*
