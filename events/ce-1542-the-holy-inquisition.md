# 1542 C.E. The Holy Inquisition

The empire reacted to reports of ethnic tension and established the *Inquisition Court* to quell the unrest and
investigate the Reformation that was causing it. [Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html):

> The institution of the inquisition was founded in 1542, and it eventually swept over the entire Western Europe. There
> has never been any such institution founded inside the Orthodox Church-it wasn't required.
> We must linger on the frequently disputed “crimes of the inquisition” for a while. We have been fed the version that

The court's mission was also the eradication of sodomy, witchcraft, and other "perversions" that allegedly resulted in
the recent 1492 Apocalypse. It also went after belief systems antithetical to the Churches teachings such as Sun worship
or [Copernicanism](https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system). French
poet [Celestin Douais](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html) claimed:

> [the inquisition courts] were created in the interests of the heretics, saving them from pogroms, indiscriminate
> massacres and uncontrollable persecution. The inquisition courts also contributed to the preservation of the epoch’s
> civilisation, helping to maintain order and to curb the propagation of major evils, protecting the century’s interests
> and truly standing guard of social justice and the Christian ideology

  When the populace searched for answers, the ecclesiastical hierarchy lectured them on how the Black Death was God’s
  retribution for their wicked ways. In Spain, tolerance of the “killers of Christ” was among them. Soon tales of Jews

#### Heresy of the Judaizers

While Western Romanov / Scalagerian history praises the Protestant Reformation as good and criticizes the Inquisition as
bad, the opposite perspective was held in the east-that the Inquisition was necessary, and that the Protestant
Reformation was a *heresy* of a new emerging religion called **Judaism**.
[Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_01.html):

A direct result of the 1492 Apocalypse was the idealization of God's Authority in the Rus-Horde Empire as the
Monotheists cemented in place the idea that their first Tsar Andronicus-Christ was of the fictional King David
bloodline. The Tsar's family had expanded considerably since the founding of the Empire and as a result, many people
grew up believing they were of a bloodline *chosen* by God and traceable to King David. Faith in this belief became
the *foundation* of modern Judaism. Naturally, people not of this bloodline tended to disagree with that perspective.
Some claimed it was religious heresy. Others simply disagreed with the Jews when it came to their claims of authority
over finance, meat production, and world religion. Until this point, the inner functions of Deep State Monotheism
operated in secret, but merging with Eastern religions subjected Monotheism to severe scrutiny by the non -
priesthood and public. Thus began the [disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews) between the Jews
and [Gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy) which led to [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom).


![Catharism was a [dualist gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) movement based on the teachings of
  [Mary Magdalene](https://www.joannakujawa.com/mary-magdalene-the-heretics-kings-and-lovers/)
  that spread from the Crimea to southern Europe before being
  systematically [annihilated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Annihilation)
  and redacted into the Christian Bible and Islamic [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_in_Islam).
  This is why both major religious text consider Mary Magdalene to be exalted among women.
  Catharism emphasised personal spiritual knowledge (Gnosis)
  and [rejects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Organization)
  every 'orthodox' belief system and ritual practiced by the Catholic Church.
  Cathars considered religions inspired by Saturn (Satan) to be materialistic and evil.
  They viewed the Church of Satan as a plague, and the Church viewed them as a threat.
  When the Church sent [Languedoc Knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade)
  to [convert or kill](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mvnct.7) the Cathar heretics of southern France, the
  Knights
  replied:

  *"We cannot. We have been reared in their midst. We have relatives among them and we see them living lives of
  perfection."*](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/christ/cathar_suppression.jpg?w=384)

#### Cathar Suppression

Another persecuted group were the [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) whose religion was
based largely on Gnostic Christianity, specifically on the teachings of Christ's mother Katya (Katherine). The Cathars
had traveled West since the creation of the Rus-Horde Empire spreading its influence, but since the religious schism
began their teachings became wildly unpopular in Europe. Eventually they were charged with heresy for
denying the **Divinity of Christ and the Authority of the Pope** and many were burned at the stake.
