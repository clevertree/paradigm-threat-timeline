# 2349 B.C.E. September 8 - Jupiter disappears and Venus attacks Earth

The last Absu layer surrounding the remaining planets becomes stressed as the nonlinear orbit becomes too wide to
support it. The configuration becomes unstable once again. Jupiter's coma-tail throne diminishes causing the gas giant
to pass through the Absu layer and disappear. The Sun turns red and vanishes. Absent the influence of Jupiter, and with
the Absu (heavens) sealed shut, _Mars and Venus go to war_. Gas planet Venus appears disheveled as she "_laments_" at
the death of the King Jupiter. She becomes **The Dragon** and lashes out at Earth and Mars with her plasma tendrils. The
violent exchange between Earth and Venus **parts the sea** forcing open the aerial Absu layer and **turning the sea
red**, which bled across the sky for three days until only one Absu ring remained.
**This was the most terrifying moment in human history**. In [Recovering the Lost World](https://saturniancosmology.org)

As the Absu collapsed, the Earth was inundated with a Second Flood of epic proportions. The Christian Bible remembers
this event as Noah's Ark, but the real subtext for this event was
[the wholesale slaughter of humanity](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/syn.php). All civilizations across Earth recall
this destructive contact with the Raging Goddess, Witch (with broom), Dragon, or Comet. Venus was associated with
Hathor, Sekhmet, and Anath in Egypt, Tiamat in Mesopotamian, Kali in Hinduism,
and [Medusa](http://www.ifiseeu.com/venus-mars-myth/terrifying-glory.htm) in Greek Mythology. In the epic poem Beowulf,
Grendel (Venus) has his arm torn off "at the shoulder" symbolizing the severing of the plasma connection between Venus
and Saturn (Grendel's Mom).

#### The length of a year increases by 20 rotations to 260 days.

The cataclysmic contact with Venus ends as "_Messiah_" Jupiter re-appears through the fading Absu. Jupiter, apparently
risen from the dead after 2.5 days, once again appears upon its coma-tail mountain (or throne). This "resurrection"
seemed to have the effect of calming the destructive rage of Venus, and She returned to spherical form. Earth's orbit
around Jupiter changes slightly resulting in a _260-day year_ and Earth manages to **capture The Moon**, which becomes
visible for the first time. With the Absu significantly reduced, stars were also visible in the southern hemisphere for
the first time.
