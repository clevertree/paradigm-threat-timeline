# Causality

In journalism, students are taught to
answer [six key questions](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/the-journalistic-six)
to allow the reader to approach a topic from various angles. Who, What, Where, When, How, and Why. Instead of
systematically dismissing mountains of testimony from our ancestors, as historians tend to do, lets **consider it** and
allow the hi-story to tell itself. We owe it to our *ancestors and our descendants both* to find the answers to these
questions.

## What is the MudFlood Energetic Event?

The *MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis* proposes that the unexplained MudFlood memories collected from around the
world starting in late 18th century were caused by a single energetic calamity. This planet-scale energy coursed
across the Earth’s surface, tearing it up and tossing matter miles into the air resulting in the destruction and
re-shaping of land masses and the covering up of cities across the planet with mud. Entire mountain ranges were
pulled out of the ground in dendritic patterns by positive electric discharge while negative discharge tore
canyons out of the earth - identical to the lightning scarring seen across the surface of Mars.

The emptied buildings of the “reset areas”, recently cleared of life, were then repopulated by orphan trains forming the
first cargo cults. Train tracks were promptly built across America, Europe, and Asia supplying humans and cargo.
Similarly, the first insane asylums were constructed across the world - everywhere the tracks led - with the purpose of
containing the memory of the Great Reset. Excavations of this buried world continued throughout the 19th and 20th
centuries, but instead of revealing the discoveries - they were surreptitiously kept secret, redacted, and even
out-right lied about. Of all the popular conspiracy theories that exist around the internet, the Mud Flood Energetic
Event stands out, opening eyes and blowing minds, and yet no hypothesis has been presented to explain _how_ it happened.

Deductively, such an event would have required a substantial release of energy to move trillions of tons of debris many
thousands of miles. We have to look for the source, because without the energy - there’s no MudFlood. For example, St.
Helens in 1980 erupted releasing 24 megatons of thermal energy resulting in 3 million cubic meters of volcanic mudflows
known as “lahars” being transported over 27 km. So,

## How did the MudFlood Event Happen?

The Mud Flood Energetic Event was caused by an interplanetary assault upon the Earth by humans who inhabit the planet
Mars. The method used to achieve this event was the construction of large-scale Directed Energy Weapons (D.E.W.) on Mars
fired at Earth during opposition (a planetary alignment). These precision instruments of war devastating sovereign
kingdoms, wiping out entire continents and islands. Locations that were not pre-selected for destruction
instead experienced heavy MudRains composed of the debris from the targeted regions.

As the Mars weapons heated the Earth’s surface, the energy built up within the Hollow Earth and eventually expelled back
through the surface as a *secondary* negative discharge. This second discharge flowed out of the earth at points of
the least resistance creating the volcanic regions known as the Ring of Fire,
arcing across America and Asia carving out canyons and melting rock.
This secondary discharge may have been unintentional as it added
a significant volume of material to the MudFlood Event that covered Eastern America and Western Europe.
It also left behind clues too big to be covered up.
