# 1776 C.E.: The Greatest Reset

With the defeat of Pugachev came another **Great Reset** and a return of Monotheistic Deep
State ruler-ship enshrined in the [Declaration of Independence 1776](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript).

> ...the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,
> is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions

By painting the native Americans as enemies of the new republic, the founders of the United States of America
would unleash upon the 'new world' everything the natives fought and died to prevent -
Slavery and debt prisons,
Usury and taxes,
Secret Societies,
Bloodline Aristocracies,
Forced mass worship and labor.
[Pledges of Allegiance](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm),
[False Flag Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror),
Endless Wars,
Genocide & Population control,
Planned obsolescence, famine, & scarcity.

The Declaration never mentioned the Tartarian Empire, much of which had already been physically destroyed.
All ties to the old empire were inherited and redacted by agents of the western European Reformation (i.e. Renaissance).
The memory of the once great world empire that stood for stability, peace, and abundance for centuries
was erased. All subjects of this former empire became 'savage indians' targeted for elimination by European colonists.
A brutal form of slavery involving chains and whips, prisons and hard labor,
became [prevalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation#United_States).
Pandora's Box was opened once again.

![The scale of deaths in the York Asylum became a national scandal since, in the course of the investigation,
  it became apparent that the level of mortality had been deliberately under-reported with the complicity of physicians.
