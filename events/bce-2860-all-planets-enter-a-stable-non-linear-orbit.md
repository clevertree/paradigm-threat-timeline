# All planets enter a stable non-linear orbit.

Jupiter's benevolent reign was a model of the ['Good King'](https://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/talbott/talbott.html)
that inspired the religions of many human nations for ages to come. Festivals around the
world [celebrate](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/festivals-dead-around-world-180953160/)
the death, resurrection, and intervention of Jupiter:
"All Saints Day" and "All Souls Day", Halloween, and "Day of the Dead" in Mexico. In Greek legend, Zeus (
Jupiter) [punishes Prometheus](http://www.firmament-chaos.com/comparative_mythology.html)
(Mars) after he provides Earth with the gift of Fire. This "punishment" was Mars was being hit by Jupiter's thunderbolts
once per orbit, causing the "liver scar"
of [Valles Marineris](https://cosmos/mars.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/valles-marineris.html). To the founders of Mosaic law, Jupiter
was the Monotheistic God upon Mount Sinai who
delivered [613 commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments). The Greek story of Prometheus would later
be re-written as the "Son of a Monotheistic God"
Jesus Christ, or [the "New Moses"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_comparative_mythology).

C.S. Lewis's "[The Chronicles of Narnia](http://www.mythsoc.org/reviews/planet-narnia.htm)"
featured an evil witch (Venus) who is intervened upon by a resurrected Lion (Jupiter). Each Narnia book secretly
represented a planet. Jupiter: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Mars: Prince Caspian. Sol: The Voyage of the “Dawn
Treader”. Luna (our Moon): The Silver Chair. Mercury: The Horse and his Boy. Venus: The Magician’s Nephew. Saturn: The
Last Battle.
