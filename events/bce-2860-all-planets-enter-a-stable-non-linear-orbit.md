# 2860 B.C.E. All planets enter a stable non-linear orbit.

Jupiter's benevolent reign was a model of the ['Good King'](https://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/talbott/talbott.html)
that inspired the religions of many human nations for ages to come. Festivals around the
world [celebrate](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/festivals-dead-around-world-180953160/)
the death, resurrection, and intervention of Jupiter:
"All Saints Day" and "All Souls Day", Halloween, and "Day of the Dead" in Mexico. In Greek legend, Zeus (
Jupiter) [punishes Prometheus](http://www.firmament-chaos.com/comparative_mythology.html)
(Mars) after he provides Earth with the gift of Fire. This "punishment" was Mars was being hit by Jupiter's thunderbolts
once per orbit, causing the "liver scar"
of [Valles Marineris](https://cosmos/mars.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/valles-marineris.html). To the founders of Mosaic law, Jupiter
was the Monotheistic God upon Mount Sinai who
delivered [613 commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments). The Greek story of Prometheus would later
be re-written as the "Son of a Monotheistic God"
Jesus Christ, or [the "New Moses"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_comparative_mythology).

C.S. Lewis's "[The Chronicles of Narnia](http://www.mythsoc.org/reviews/planet-narnia.htm)"
featured an evil witch (Venus) who is intervened upon by a resurrected Lion (Jupiter). Each Narnia book secretly
represented a planet. Jupiter: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Mars: Prince Caspian. Sol: The Voyage of the “Dawn
Treader”. Luna (our Moon): The Silver Chair. Mercury: The Horse and his Boy. Venus: The Magician’s Nephew. Saturn: The
Last Battle.

#### Jupiter replaces Saturn as the new Saviour (aka Zeus, Thor, King Arthur)

Resolving the electric imbalances between the planets, Jupiter became
[King of the planets](http://www.empirerome.com/wordpress/?page_id=708)
in the [Roman Pantheon](https://frostydrew.org/publications.dc/show/entry-611/)
and reigned over a 511-year period of stability. King Jupiter sat upon the Cosmic Mountain, also remembered by different
populations as Mount Olympus, Mount Parnassus, Mount Sinai, and others. This appearance of a 'cosmic mountain' was
actually Jupiter's South Pole plasma outpouring extended out into a massive coma tail. Once per orbit, Jupiter would
eclipse the Sun, and the King would wear the Sun's Corona as a Crown.
[Pre-Galfridian Arthurian legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur#Pre-Galfridian_traditions)
describes King Arthur (Jupiter) orbiting a 'round table' along with the greatest knight of all - Lancelot (Mars), and
the lesser knights. Together, the _Knights of the Round Table_ defended Britian from fire-monsters (The Sun), as well as
dragons and witches (Venus). During this period, the nonlinear orbit between planets grew larger and more unstable
resulting in the
inevitable [Breaking of the Round Table.](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2015/08/king-arthur-and-his-part-in-the-breaking-of-the-round-table/)

#### Pyramids were Portals

During this time, it was again possible for humans to exploit powerful natural Birkeland Currents coursing between the
planets in Jupiter's orbit. Humans on each planet uncover natural electromagnetic ley lines and build Pyramids upon
those locations. With the help of human giants, civilizations build all the pyramids of
Egypt, Mesopotamia, England, China, and in the South America Andes in less than 200 years.
This "Artificial Bifröst" quantum entanglement facility made it once
again possible for humans to travel between the planets.
**All pyramids
are [man-made quantum tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)**
built at locations of concentrated cosmic energy (entanglements) between planets.
