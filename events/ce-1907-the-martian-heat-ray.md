# The Martian Heat Ray

One connection between this book and modern times is the U.S. Military's
[Active Denial System](https://healthimpactnews.com/2017/can-new-5g-technology-and-smart-meters-be-used-as-weapons/).
This [crowd control vehicle](https://files.paradigmthreat.net/cosmos/mars/heat_ray.jpg) has built upon it
a heat ray device that looks *precisely* like the heat ray described in the book:

"This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished
parabolic mirror of unknown composition".
Why did the [War of the Worlds album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Wayne%27s_Musical_Version_of_The_War_of_the_Worlds)
and all [the movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_based_on_The_War_of_the_Worlds)
**cover-up** this design by switching the Heat Ray to a 'tall funnel'?
Because 'Heat-Ray' technology became a classified military secret in the 20th century.
Realistic depictions of heat-ray technology would become suppressed.
