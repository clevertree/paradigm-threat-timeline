# Giovanni Exposes Mars to the Public

During the planet's "great opposition" of 1877, [Giovanni Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Schiaparelli#Mars) observed a dense network of
linear structures on the surface of Mars which he called "canali" (Channels in Italian)
leading to speculation about artificial construction and the potential for intelligent life on Mars.
In his book *Life on Mars*, he wrote:

> Rather than true channels in a form familiar to us, we must imagine depressions in the soil
that are not very deep, extended in a straight direction for thousands of miles,
over a width of 100, 200 kilometres and maybe more. I have already pointed out that,
in the absence of rain on Mars, these channels are probably the main mechanism by which
the water (and with it organic life) can spread on the dry surface of the planet.

!["Mars and Its Canals" by Percival Lowell, published in 1906 details Lowell's theories and observations about the
  canals of Mars, which he believed were built by an intelligent civilization to transport water across the planet](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/cosmos/mars/cosmos/mars_canals5.jpg?w=360)
