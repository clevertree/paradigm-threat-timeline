# Timeline synchronization

As a result of the
deliberate [destruction and obfuscation of indigenous culture worldwide](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-resistance-new-colonialism)
by the Holy Roman Empire, we have an array of conflicting dates of common events. Some examples of different dates of
*"Creation"* are:

```
5969 B.C. - Antiochian by Theophilus
5872 B.C. - "dating of the seventy interpreters"
5508 B.C. - Byzantine dating a.k.a. "The Constantinople version"
5493 B.C. - Alexandrian, the Annian era, (also 5472 or 5624)
5515 B.C. - by Theophilus (also 5507)
5500 B.C. - by Hippolytus and Sextus Julius Africanus
5199 B.C. - by Eusebius of Caesarea
4700 B.C. - Samarian
4004 B.C. - Hebraic dating by Usher
3761 B.C. - Judaic
3491 B.C. - by Hieronymus
```

This project's starting point was the [reconstructed timeline](https://saturniancosmology.org/short.htm) of events
by [Jno Cook's](https://jnocook.net/) starting with a creation date
of [4077 B.C](https://saturniancosmology.org/rec.php#rec-c25h)
which is based on
the [Quiche Maya](https://www.ancient.eu/article/414/maya-religion-the-light-that-came-from-beside-the/). His
book [Recovering the Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Lost-World-Jno-Cook/dp/0997237910)
provides a reconstruction of events based on indigenous records which re-interpret Earth's *Origin Story* in the words
of our ancestors who _were alive when it all happened_.

![[The Electric Universe Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Universe-Wallace-Thornhill/dp/B007SP1LK8) posits that
  galaxies, stars (including our Sun), and comets can be best understood through the well-tested behavior of
  electricity—the one force about which astronomers seem to know almost nothing, a force that is 1036 or more times as
  strong as gravity.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/cosmos/cosmology/hollow_earth/hollow_earth_EU_model.jpg?w=384)
