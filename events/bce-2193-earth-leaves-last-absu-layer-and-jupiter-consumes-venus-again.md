# 2193 B.C.E. Earth leaves last Absu layer and Jupiter consumes Venus again

This new period of stability lasts another 156 years and ends abruptly when the nonlinear configuration loses its last
Absu layer. Exposed to the Sun's electromagnetic field, each planet forms its
own [magnetosphere](http://www.plasmacosmology.net/tech.html). Seasons begin on Earth for the first time. The formations
of deserts during this period force the populations of Western Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and North Africa to
migrate. The Egyptian and [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) kingdoms collapse. The Earth is
still in the nonlinear orbit with Jupiter, and the year extends to 273 days. It would be another 200 years before Egypt
repopulates beginning the [Middle Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt) period. As Venus
becomes exposed to the Sun's field, it retreats into the safety of Jupiter's magnetosphere, and becomes once again
_consumed into the Gas Giant's interior_.

#### The length of a year increases by 13 rotations to 273 days.

At the same time, northern populations of the Earth experienced an ice-age lasting well over 200 years.
In [Egyptian Myth and Catastrophism](http://firmament-chaos.com/papers/EgyptianarticleV2.pdf) Robert Ackerman explains:

> It is of interest that mythologies of countries where the fiery-dragon (proto-Venus)
> cannot be correlated with heat or drought, such as the Norse, preserve it as a representative of winter.
> This can be explained in the catastrophism scenario by the fact that during the Vedic Period, Proto-Venus,
> still sporting its comet-like tail, came closest to the Earth at the time of the release of
> priori-Mars from geosynchronous orbit. On those occasions the mantle of the Earth would return to
> its normal rotation about the North Pole, at which position the Norse lands would be much farther
> from the equator than when priori-Mars orbited the Earth.
