# Giants Roamed the Earth

  In America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, the expurgation of our large-scale human brethren is today known as the
Smithsonian Cover Up. How and why did the giants die?
The [giant mounds](http://www.wisconsinmounds.com/DestroyedMounds.html) found all over America may not be
burial mounds as commonly thought, but instead may be the result of the MudFlood Energetic Event. During this event, the
giants were wiped out by catastrophic electric discharges from the ground and atmosphere. The giants were too large and
there was nowhere to hide. As they were struck down, their bones became instantaneously fossilized, and then buried
forming the 'burial' mounds as well as 'dinosaur' fossil sites.
Often fossil were found in "graveyards" or mass mortality sites where a large number of petrified bones have been found,
often clustered together, suggesting a catastrophic event that wiped out many individuals at once.
Petrification by electricity has been [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmb0CSXF53w)
in a laboratory by the [Safire Project](https://www.safireproject.com/).
Dinosaur fossils therefore may not be millions of years old,
but misidentified giant fossils created recently in the MudFlood event.

To the Deep State, giants of Earth represented one of the few remaining unconquered races, and an existential threat.
Therefore, the wiping out of the giants was not an accident. The Smithsonian project began in 1846, systematically
destroying burial mounds across America, eliminating the evidence of the last civilization. What giant bones could not
be covered up were recategorized by the Natural History Museum as ancient *dinosaur* fossils. As a result of this cover
up, Historians have concluded that native Americans were of average human height and live in tents and caves on Stone
Age technology. They further insist that the many incredible Tartarian structures were built not by Americans but by
Europeans in the early 19th century, who then abruptly lost the technology to build these structures entirely. A more
convincing explanation is that picturesque Tartarian structures were all built by giant humans.
Why else would so many of them have giant entrance doors?

#### The 'Red-Skin' Native American Survivors of the MudFlood

The only direct survivors of the Mudflood that stuck around afterward were the 'Red-Skin' Native Americans.
These were the direct relatives of the Lamanites (human giants) who were killed in the MudFlood Energetic Event.
The heat of the event turned their skin red. Shortly after, they were hunted to near extinction.
Those who capitulated were relocated to Asia across the Bering Strait (Trail of Tears).
After the relocation, the Bering Strait was destroyed by the same cannon(s) that destroyed Siberia and America.
