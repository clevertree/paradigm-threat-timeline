# Human Activity on Mars

Martians have been described for centuries by religious authors such as Jesuit Athanasius Kircher who testified to
having visited each planet (even [inside the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RbXIMZmVv8)),
and [Creationist Emanuel Swedenborg](https://books.google.com/books?id=0wxOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)
inventor of [Uniformitarianism](https://www.britannica.com/science/uniformitarianism) (a century before
Hutton) and Nebular Accretion Theory in 1734 both still taught as fact in _secular_ schools today. The famous book
Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, categorized as fiction, described details of
the [Martian moons](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Swift.html) in 1727 a hundred
and fifty years before they were first discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. Intelligent activity has been observed in
detail by early astronomers like Sir William Herschel who believed all our planets (including our Sun) were inhabited,
Giovanni Schiaparelli who saw man-made water channels on Mars, and of course Percival Lowell who in 1895 mapped out the
channels using a precision observatory he built in Flagstaff. At that same time, John Jacob Astor IV, 16 years before he
faked his own death on the Titanic, published testimony where he visited each planet, and yet again, traveled inside our
Sun.

If these narratives are considered redacted from their original versions and posited as fiction, the possibility emerges
of planet Mars as home to a break-away human civilization which has influenced Earthly affairs during the entirety of
our shared history. Earth and Mars share thousands of years of recorded history, and during that time it is unlikely
that our inner-solar system affairs were exploited by any visiting lifeforms from other solar systems. The Saturnian
Golden Age was described as a time of high technology and advanced primordial life, so _any visiting aliens_ wouldn’t
have stood out back then.

Even today, Martians may look considerably different from you and me, - maybe cold-blooded, having green, scaly, or even
mutated skin - but they are still _humans_, our brothers and sisters. Their different appearances from us on Earth are a
result of having survived the colder, harsher conditions within Mars and on its surface throughout antiquity. An
overabundance of ores like iron, platinum, titanium, palladium, and chromium gave the Martians an early technological
start. However, their lack of agrarian and prolific resources drove them to seek subjugation of humans on Earth in order
to extract those resources. This subjugation was achieved through the suppression and controlled release of religion and
technology throughout history. Advanced communication, Free Energy, antigravity, and advanced weaponry were invented on
Mars centuries before they appeared on Earth.
