# 1431 C.E. Jeanne d'Arc is executed in Rouen, France

> Note: The death of Joan of Arc was apparently moved back 150 years, so expect this section to change.

The Rus-Horde (aka Ottoman) Empire continued to encounter resistance to its conquest of Western Europe. One of the
biggest examples of resistance was the legendary *Joan of Arc*. Fomenko demonstrates how this story is also a
duplicate of a story of the prophetess and warrior Deborah narrated in chapters 4-5 of the Old Testament Book of

Although she wore armor, she never once fought in battle. Instead, the armor was meant to protect her from arrows as she
met with Hordian soldiers. She was injured twice by arrows while attempting diplomatic solutions to end the
Siege of Orleans (October 1428 – 8 May 1429). Nevertheless, Jeanne d'Arc’s diplomatic evangelism convinced the Hordian
army to give up the siege. It was clear this French maiden had a bewitching influence on the Hordian soldiers to such a
degree that it threatened the entire war campaign.

![When creating the Scaligerian history all of these large-scale campaigns were artificially 'squeezed' into the
  territory of one county in France, greatly reducing the scale of events. As a result some of the distant
  geographical names also 'moved' here. And the entire story of Joan of Arc turned into an allegedly 'purely French'
  story. Furthermore, it turns out that the famous French marshal Gilles de Rais, Joan of Arc's legendary
  comrade-in-arms, is partially described in the Bible under the name of Samson, the famous hero and warrior. This
  congruence is a result of the stories of Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah overlapping each other. Marshal
  Gilles de Rais, French national hero, faced the Inquisition court and was burnt at the stake in the town of Nante
 -one of the most infamous landmark cases 'on witchcraft'. All three storylines are directly connected with the
  activities of the Inquisition on the territory of France (in the Scaligerian geography).](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/tartaria/painting_samson_and_delilah_by_rubens.jpg?w=384)


This forced the hand of the Deep State which saw no other option than to *catharize* Jeanne d'Arc before their own
subjects. In 1430, she was captured by the Burgundians, who in exchange for money handed her over to the Hordian Empire,
who were desperate to keep their own bewitched soldiers in line. They declared Jeanne d'Arc a witch and put her on
ecclesiastical court trial for charges of "insubordination and heterodoxy". She was burnt at the stake in the Old Market
Square of Rouen on May 30, 1431. This tactic backfired and led to further Hordian troop demoralization and eventually to
the end of the Hundred Years war. Nearly 500 years later in 1920 she was canonized by the Catholic church.
