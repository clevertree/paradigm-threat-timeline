# Monotheism set back by Crusades

In 1185 C.E. Monotheists, still clinging to the fallen Atlantean/Egyptian religion,
famously crucified Christ (a human giant), thinking his challenges against their
church would die with him. However, despite the crucifixion, the Christian revolution survived and even
gained momentum due to a successful Crusade launched in retaliation.
According to the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html),
Christ’s brother brought his body back from Istanbul to Crimea, followed by a congregation of smaller-sized
humans and became the first Tsar of Russia.
The success of the 1196 C.E. Crusade laid the groundwork for the
Russian-Hordian Empire which destroyed the Church, and its Monotheistic doctrine.
The Hordian empire would honor **all** gods in defiance with the Church's First Commandment
and eventually expanded into a global empire until its fall in 1775.
In the version of the story found in Shingō Japan, Christ's brother died on the Cross
and Christ himself [survived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Jesus) to found the Empire.
