# C.E. Rex Bellator plan unifies all military orders

By the middle of the 17th century, The Deep State had successfully infiltrated the religions of *every region* on Earth,
leaving behind a disarray of religious disputes and anti-syncretism, and preparing the military orders of each kingdom
for a final unification under its control. The plan manifested as a religious crusade to reconquer the "holy lands" of
the Turkish (i.e. Ottoman) region of the fractured Russian Empire, this time in the name of a Messiah-Jesus Christ
the *Rex Bellator* (which [translates](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bellator)
to [Warrior King](https://christianitymatters.com/2013/12/26/jesus-the-warrior-king/)). The Chronologists of the
Deep State would later shift these campaigns 370 years backwards into the 13th Century to place it within the period of
religious crusades started by the Russian Hordian Empire. Spanish Wikipedia describes
the [Rex Bellator Plan](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bellator):

> The plan consisted of the unification of the military orders (in the first two treaties, making clear the pre-eminence
> of the Templars and [Hospitallers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller), and in the third,
> distinguishing the Hospitallers to the north and the orders of the Iberian Peninsula to the south), placing a "Rex
> Bellator", a warrior king, widowed or single, at its head.
