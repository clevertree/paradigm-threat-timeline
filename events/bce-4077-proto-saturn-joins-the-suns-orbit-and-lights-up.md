# Proto-Saturn joins the Sun's orbit and lights up

*The discovery that objects from the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age carry patterns associated with high-current Z-pinches provides a possible insight into the origin and meaning of these ancient symbols produced by humans. Part I deals with the comparison of graphical and radiation data from high current Z-pinches to petroglyphs, geo-glyphs, and megaliths. Part II focuses on the source of light and its temporal change from a current-increasing Z-pinch or dense-plasma-focus aurora.

As Saturn's body entered
our [positively charged Sun's](http://altcosmology.com/The-Sun-is-Electrically-Positively-Charged.php)
orbit, Saturn became connected to the Sun's electrical environment as
a [negatively charged cathode](https://www.holoscience.com/wp/cassinis-homecoming/).
Saturn's system drew energy from the Sun into itself as
a [super-capacitor](https://www.instructables.com/The-Forever-Rechargeable-VARIABLE-Super-Capacitor-/)
would until it became 'full', at which point the Saturn
system [exploded](http://quantavolution.net/vol_03/chaos_creation_08.htm)
creating the gas planets Jupiter, Venus, Uranus and Neptune.
