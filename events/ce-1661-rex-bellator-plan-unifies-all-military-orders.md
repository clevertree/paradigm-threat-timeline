# 1661 to 1679 C.E. Rex Bellator plan unifies all military orders

By the middle of the 17th century, The Deep State had successfully infiltrated the religions of *every region* on Earth,
leaving behind a disarray of religious disputes and anti-syncretism, and preparing the military orders of each kingdom
for a final unification under its control. The plan manifested as a religious crusade to reconquer the "holy lands" of
the Turkish (i.e. Ottoman) region of the fractured Russian Empire, this time in the name of a Messiah-Jesus Christ
the *Rex Bellator* (which [translates](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bellator)
to [Warrior King](https://christianitymatters.com/2013/12/26/jesus-the-warrior-king/)). The Chronologists of the
Deep State would later shift these campaigns 370 years backwards into the 13th Century to place it within the period of
religious crusades started by the Russian Hordian Empire. Spanish Wikipedia describes
the [Rex Bellator Plan](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bellator):

> The plan consisted of the unification of the military orders (in the first two treaties, making clear the pre-eminence
> of the Templars and [Hospitallers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller), and in the third,
> distinguishing the Hospitallers to the north and the orders of the Iberian Peninsula to the south), placing a "Rex
> Bellator", a warrior king, widowed or single, at its head.

#### Deep State plans a second Apocalypse in the year ι666

The opportunity for another Apocalypse came with the approaching date of <code>ι</code>666 written as
<code>in the 666th year of the Lord</code>. The Deep State's motivations were the same as in 1492 C.E.-to strike the
*fear of God* into the Protestants and consolidate the local governments under the centralized authority of the Church.
Having conquered all remaining world religions, the **Deep State** was in a position to misrepresent ancient chronologies
of their conquered vassals, specifically-the violent memory of the *ending* of the Golden Age. Going forward, the
Apocalypse date would be represented not as a history of the Earth's formation, but as a *prophecy* of how the world
will end in the *future* - with a
[sudden intervention](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)
by the creator god [Jehovah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah).

> During the first half of the seventeenth century some extravagant notions of the near approach of the Messianic time,
> and more especially of the redemption of the Jews and their return to Jerusalem, were set forth by Christian writers
> and entertained by Jews and Christians alike. The so - called apocalyptic year was assigned by Christian authors to the
> year 1666.

![The Polish theologian, historian and astronomer, Stanisław Lubieniecki (1623–1675) observed both comets from his
  house in Hamburg. He corresponded with Ismäel Boulliau (1605–1694) in Paris and Henry Oldenburg (1618–1677), secretary
  of the Royal Society in London about the 1664 comet. In 1668 he published a three-part work on both comets, his
  Theatrum cometicum. Part one contained his correspondence on the topic with other European astronomers. The second
  part consisted of criticism by other scholars of his cometary theories and his answers to his critics, whilst the
  third part contained his astrological interpretations, including his opinion that the Great Fire of London was a
  punishment from God announced by the 1664 comet.
