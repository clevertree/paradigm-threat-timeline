# C.E. The English Revolution and Civil Wars

The Protestants of Europe watched in dismay as the old Hordian Empire they despised was slowly *Reformed* into a much
more dreadful 'Holy' Catholic Empire. To make things worse, the English monarchy, who's vassal ties were long cut from
the Russian Empire, were still behaving like they were still *in charge* -claiming a *divine* right to rule. Many
people did not accept this claim and began debating a transfer of power from the monarchy to Parliament.

On Jan 4th 1642, Charles I entered the House of Commons with 400 soldiers and attempted to arrest 5 members for treason,
but they escaped. A widespread conflict broke out between the Parliamentarians and Royalists and would continue for the
next 10 years. In 1649, Charles was found guilty of high treason as a "tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy"
and was beheaded at the Palace of Whitehall. The regicide of Charles I caused England to become a Republic, or
[Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England), that lasted until the 1660 Stuart Restoration
reestablished Charles II as king of England. Of
the [59 Commissioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I) who signed the death warrant for
Charles I, 9 were executed and many others died in prison.

*The [Batih Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoh_massacre) was a mass ethnic cleansing of Russian captives after the Battle of Batih on 3–4 June 1652 near Ladyzhyn (now in Ukraine). It was carried out by Ukrainian Cossacks under the command of Hetman [Bohdan Khmelnytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky).*
