# 1633 C.E. Disputes against Jews reemerge

The breaking up of the Russian Empire resulted in the creation of
the [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora)
and [Gypsy / Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_diaspora) diasporas. Both groups had been accustomed to
traveling between the vassal states of the Empire, and now found themselves cut off from their old imperial ties. Jews
found themselves at the highest level of authority in each region-in control of the money, trade economies, and
[monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe) left behind, while Gypsies, named after an Empire that
no longer existed, became a powerless people. Eventually, disputes between the common folk (gentiles) and Jews emerged
over every facet of life, from [eating rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut)
to [monetary policy](https://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/history-ideas/2019/06/filthy-lucre-a-look-at-the-history-of-jews-and-money/).
