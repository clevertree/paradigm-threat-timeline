# Trigger: Annihilation of the Giant Humans

The MudFlood Energetic Event was triggered as a result of the need to defeat the
[Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) in 1773.
The cause for the Rebellion itself was the attempts by the Romanov-controlled state to
impose taxation and slavery on Cossacks, serfs, and tribal communities.
Pugachev was a giant human, as were much of his army.
He was also Peter the 3rd - Descendant of Christ and actual heir to the Russian throne.
He was not an imposter as the Romanov historians say.
For this reason, he was leading a rebellion of both giants and smaller-sized humans
against the authority of the Romanovs who had seized control of the empire during the bloody Oprichnina.

Pugachev and other giants were the biggest threat to the Church, and it's doctrine.
The Rebellion of Pugachev was the 3rd major war between humans and giants.
The first was the Crusade of the early 12th century (See [history/chronology](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/history/chronology)).
The 2nd was the battle of Kulikovo (1380) where the giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology
of the smaller humans. In this battle, *Royal* christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today
(Canonization). However, in Pugachev's time, giants had their own cannons and were masters of 'guerrilla' warfare.
His rebellion was seen as a threat to all the military religious orders of the world, who were just as likely to
join Pugachev as to fight against him.

This rebellion forced the Deep State’s hand, requiring a correction of the most extreme nature -
a cataclysmic reset of life on Earth.
The Deep State chose not to reveal itself or its technology in this event, knowing the survivors would defer to
the church’s conclusion - that the defeat of Pugachev was a divine intervention by an angry creator god.
Giants were already hunted and eliminated throughout Europe by the Church, thus this one event
eliminated the *remaining* human giants of the world in a single blow.
If any survived, they got the message and left our plane permanently to reside in unknown regions (i.e. Hollow Earth).

It's important to also note
that the House of Romanov who defeated Pugachev worked overtime to remove themselves from the story - posing the
Rebellion as a peasant uprising **against** an alleged *impostor* 'Pugachev' who was posing as Peter III.
No surviving records describe under what circumstances the real 'Pugachev' was killed.
[Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html):

> With Suvorov's help, count P.I.Panin, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Front,
defeated the Siberian army of 'Pugachev'.
Suvorov personally convoyed the captured 'Pugachev' from Yaik to Simbirsk.
He was later brought to Moscow and executed there,
after purporting that he was a common Cossack who had rebelled against the rightful rulers – the Romanovs.
Most likely, it was in fact some common Cossack who was brought for the execution,
but **not the real Siberian war chief**. It is possible that he was called 'Pugachev'.
The true identity of the Siberian leader was probably kept secret by the Romanovs.
The two SECRET PANELS which were set up in Kazan and Orenburg in 1773-1774,
were in charge of the misrepresentation of the Pugachev war history.

## Where was the MudFlood Event?

The primary target for this event was the splintered Rus-Horde Empire which the West referred to as the
Great Tartary. The primary goal of this maximal damage campaign was to eliminate all temporal resistance to the Deep
State’s plans and prevent a human empire from ever reorganizing on Earth. The secondary goal
of the Deep State was to preserve the churches and mosques of the Rus-Horde Empire,
stealing its history, redacting its indigenous Hoardian languages into
Latin Root, splintering its religious icons, and rebranding itself as the “Holy” Roman Empire.

  a negative electric scarring.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/secondary_negative_discharge.jpg?w=360)

The Rus-Horde Empire broke up in 1775 as a result of the defeat of Siberian war chief Pugachev in the Cossack Rebellion.
Up until that point, Tartarian vassal states spanned every continent. Now
these states would fall under the influence of the new Deep State.
Those who resisted the church edict were eliminated and their descendants enslaved - as *promised*.
The mythical Kingdoms of the Pacific Islands were systematically annihilated -
electrically machined into lifeless atolls by the Mars weapons. Fortresses as far north as Scotland were annihilated
leaving behind melted ruins.
The giants of western America and eastern Eurasia were eradicated leaving behind hundreds of thousands of
[burial mounds](http://www.wisconsinmounds.com/DestroyedMounds.html). The weapons carved out land masses like Zealandia, Lemuria, and the Bering
Land Bridge leaving submerged continents.
Mesas, never before seen on Earth, formed across Western America, North Africa,
and the Middle East. Mountains melted in Australia. Alchemic electrical scarring left painted rainbow canyons in China
and Tibet. Many Tartarian cathedrals like in St Petersburg and Salt Lake City harnessed the electric onslaught and
survived.

  in the Grand Canyon, AZ](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/grand_canyon_criscross_lightning_scar.jpg?w=360)


The American west coasts were hit by an uncontrollable secondary negative electric discharge that arced across the
continent leaving behind a snaking electric scar over a thousand miles long - forming the Colorado River. In the dry
desert region the discharge became so large in amplitude that it tore into the Earth creating the Grand Canyon and the
Great Basin. Such dendritic scarring and incredible red rock formations like this are found nowhere else on Earth; yet
are seen across the surface of Mars - a planet which experienced intense negative electric discharge in the distant
past. Andrew Hall describes how electric discharges sculpted the american SouthWest:


> “... the land was zapped, carved and seared by electrical storms that could have happened last year, so fresh looked
> the marks of evidence.”_

As the wreckage from these land masses filled the earth’s atmosphere and moved further away from the targeted zones,
this debris cooled and fell to Earth as “Mud”. Western Europe and Eastern America were hit by Mudfloods. Online today,
one can find many pictures of Tartarian buildings in America, Europe where the earth level has risen significantly above
the first floor with no explanation given. Also, one can find various paintings of an event where reddish mud known as
“BloodRain” fell from the sky.

#### The Secondary Discharge backfired on Mars

It appears that whoever fired the energy weapons at Earth either did not fully understand the risk, or did not care.
The direction of the energy through the body of the Earth would be ultimately determined by variations in
Earth Density.
Either way, in a desperate bid to defeat Pugachev, the cannons may have been fired **too rapidly** resulting in a
Secondary Discharge as the energy passed through the Earth at the target point, and exited the Earth from a secondary
point elsewhere. Mars was in opposition at the time, and thus the energy fired at the Earth would largely return to
Mars and cause further damage. Such an event is implied in the dialog of the Martian intro in the WotW PC game:

If we study the similarities between science fiction narratives, specifically related to interplanetary war
like Ender's Game, Battlefield Earth, StarWars, Stargate, Scientology, War of the Worlds etc.,
we might find a repeating story: a planet attacks another planet, but suffers a catastrophic *blow-back* as a
result.

This predictive programming suggests that life on Mars has not reached exhaustion due to being *very ancient*, but
rather as a result of their planetary ecosystem taking a massive hit during the MudFlood Energetic Event.
Clearly the majority of Martians did not agree with nor benefit from this attack on Earth;
in every version of the story the instigator of the war
(Ender, Terl, Palpatine, Goa'uld System Lord, Xenu, Senior Elder etc.) was deposed exiled and/or executed.

## When was the MudFlood?

Most MudFlood researchers will place the event between the late 18th and early 19th century when we find an abundance
of photos of “reset cities” cleared of life, and Tartarian buildings and other monuments buried stories into the ground.
This is a good time period to look for a geopolitical trigger for the event.
In the 16th-17th century, the rebellious Reformation of Western Europe began to detach itself
(and its military religious orders)
from the Tartarian Empire. Spain issued the [*Requerimiento of 1513*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Requirement_of_1513)
(most likely this date was pushed back around 150 years by historic redactors)
outlining another plan for world domination
(see [Rex Bellator 1291 C.E.](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bellator))
and offering the indigenous people of former Tartarian lands a choice -
slavery and annihilation - threatening their families with subjection to the “yoke and obedience of the Church and of
their Highness's”. The natives were not threatened by this yet, and tolerated the emergence of Catholics and Protestant
colonists on their land up until the middle of the 18th century, when they finally put up a massive rebellion
led by Pugachev.

The trigger for the rebellion was efforts by the Reformist (Catholic/Protestant) Church to impose taxation and slavery
upon American lands leading up to the Townshend Acts of 1767 and the Boston Tea Party of 1773 when Mohawk (giants)
tossed 342 chests of tea into the harbor in protest. The Reformation Historians then redacted the memory of the
Tea Party eliminating the influence of natives by claiming that instead
'colonists disguised themselves as Native Americans'.

## Why did the MudFlood Energetic Event happen?

In 1774, Pugachev's rebellion reached a peak, and claiming to be Peter III and a direct descendant of Christ,
Pugachev was in a position to claim rulership of the *entire Tartarian Empire* and overthrow the foreign House of
Romanov that had ruled the empire since the Oprichnina. Had this happened, Pugachev would have been in a position to
smash the Western European Reformation/Renaissance that threatened the Tartarian empire for so long.
Had he accomplished that, the Russian Tartarian Empire could have returned to its former glory with a vengeance
re-conquering the entire world, and imposing upon it a Second Inquisition that would have erased the
Reformation/Renaissance and Monotheism, and along with them, slavery, usury, and everything else in *Pandora's Box*.

![Contemplating the nature
  of [electromagnetic induction](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnetic-induction.html),
  humans built the first cathedrals and minarets between 806 and 687 B.C.E.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/../history/chronology/saturn/cathoderal.jpg?w=360)

The Protestant Reformation that was planning to erase the Russian empire was sponsored largely by humans on Mars over
the course of history - with Martian agents appearing as angels in cathodic telepathic visions.
These same influences on Mars would not suffer seeing all their plans and efforts over hundreds of years destroyed
as a result of the Rebellion and took desperate measures to reverse Pugachev's accomplishments
and preserve the Renaissance - they built and fired one or more massive energy cannons built on Mars targeting each city
liberated by Pugachev. By the end of the war in 1775, all of Siberia, the once great Tartarian Kingdom, remained a
wasteland, with all of its mythical locations melted and/or buried.

## Who caused the MudFlood?

![Woodcut with   early hand colouring from Conrad Lycosthenes' (Chronicle of Prodigies and Omens) - 'Prodigiorum ac Ostentorum Chronicon'
  Published Hendricus Petri, Basel, allegedly 1557. This image appears to show a shower of meteorites - Lycosthenes notes
  they are **stones** and not hail.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/1557_lycosthenes_rain_of_stones_meteorite.jpg?w=360)

The only entity capable of causing such destruction was the advanced human civilization living on Mars
which had broken away after the Golden Age. Until the war of 1773, Human Martians had used cathodal
churches and telepathy to play God on Earth, perform espionage, and speak to religious leaders through
'visions of angels'. Through simple tricks,
they managed to consolidate nearly all religious military orders of the Earth via treaties like Rex Bellator.
The only demographic they could not consolidate were the human giants, partially because they were difficult
to defeat in battle, and partially because they historically rejected Monotheism.

The entity known as the Deep State is as old as humanity itself and is located in all the secret places of the Earth, as
well as places we were told humans cannot live, like on planet Mars. In their desperation to stop Pugachev, they
employed the use of large-scale directed energy weapons on Mars that would become the instrument that reversed
the victories of the rebellion,
annihilating his army along with the infrastructure of the Russian Hordian Empire and its allies. Starting in 1774,
the Mars weapons eliminated all threats to the Deep State on Earth and set the stage for a reset of history. By doing it
this way, the Deep State covered up its own involvement while striking the fear of God into the survivors who had
little choice but to accept the Church’s conclusion -
that Pugachev’s defeat was Divine Retribution by God for insubordination.

During the 40+ years of the MudFlood Event, much of the Earth became an unlivable desert. Many ecosystems in
places like the Middle East, North Africa, Australia etc. never recovered and remain deserts. If the Deep State
caused the MudFlood Event, then they were in a unique position to become the saviors of humanity as life on earth began
to die at increasing rates. Playing God, the Deep State chose a new set of Israelites to survive the apocalypse.
These “chosen” humans were kept alive via cargo (or “mana”) from a mysterious supplier that
posed itself as the Creator God of the Universe. Eventually, this same God offers the Israelites a slave contract known
as *The Mosaic Covenant* or *“10 Commandments”* and promises if they live by the contract, that they will be delivered
to a 'promised' land. So, after surviving the **40+ years wandering the MudFlooded desert**, agents of the
Deep State deliver each Israelite group to the relative ‘Promised Land’ - as promised.
Those Israelites who disobeyed God’s command quickly perished, either denied cargo and starved,
or were slaughtered by their peers in an attempt to appease *God’s wrath*.
Events of the Mudflood were then further redacted into the Old Testament *Exodus* narrative, 
[converted to indigenous languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Version)
and redistributed in the 19th century.
