# The Pyramidal Empire and the Exodus

Eventually Earth found itself in Jupiter's orbit, and this new "King" would bring stability to the cataclysm age.
It would again become possible for a quantum entanglement to occur between Earth and Mars.
To survive the electric storms and cataclysmic debris, the humans built the pyramids (a form of ancient cathedral) along the
equatorial zones of the Earth and Mars where the amplitude of the strikes were greatest.
Building pyramids on these 'ley-line' locations would additionally re-enable the periodic quantum entanglements
between planets that terminated within the pyramid walls. This allowed the Atlantean priest class to once again
assume a rulership position over the rest of the species.

The Egyptian/Pyramidal empire lasted from 3147 B.C.E. until its fall in 1492 B.C.E.
when it was hit by a series of
[Plagues](https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz7neg/electric-universe-theory-thunderbolts-project-wallace-thornhill)
which were caused by Jupiter's ejecting of Venus.
Velikovsky interprets the 'Passover' of the Exodus as the passing of the Dragon/Comet/Planet Venus
very close to the Earth causing widespread cataclysm.

The *Exodus* story in the Old Testament was a real story about the first time the Deep State
lost control of the Earth/Mars gates due to shifting conditions within the Solar System. The story was later redacted
to exclude most humanity and add divine intervention. The first human-made Mars Gates were the Pyramids,
which exist all over the world.
The Egyptian 'slaves' weren't Jews, they were all humans on Earth, but mostly
humans in the Southern Hemisphere.

The religion of Ancient Egypt worshiped the Old Testament "Tri-form" God known as Osiris,
however, the *unforetold* passing of Venus proved their rulers did not represent God.
In "Moses and Monotheism", Sigmund Freud posits that Moses was of Egyptian royalty, rather than a 'Hebrew slave',
and it was the *priest* class and **not the slaves** that left the pyramids in the *Exodus*.
In Egyptian tradition of (Sun vs Set), Osiris (the old Sun) was killed by his brother Set, cut into many pieces, and scattered.
The story goes on that Venus dropped some kind of edible primordial carbohydrate material
onto the Earth that the Israelites of the Exodus lived off of for 40 years.
This part of the story could have been redacted from the 18th-19th Century
during the Mudflood Energetic Event after the
Pugachev Rebellion 1774. The war resulted in 40 years of desert on earth,
and the causers of that war (humans on Mars) did seek out survivors to fill the reset cities (promised land).
