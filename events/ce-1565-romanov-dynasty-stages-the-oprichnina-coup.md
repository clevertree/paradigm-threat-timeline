# 1565 C.E. Romanov Dynasty stages "The Oprichnina" coup

The oppression known as the [Oprichnina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprichnina) begins when Czar-khan Ivan 'the
terrible' IV falls ill and retires to the monastery effectively abdicating the throne. The relatives of the Czar,
the [Zakharyins-Romanovs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Romanovich_Zakharyin-Yuriev) stage a coup taking over the
court and assume ruler-ship of the kingdom. They subsequently order the assassination of the Hordian elite and military
commanders including the legitimate heirs to the throne. This event marks the beginning of the *darkest period* in Russian history.

#### Redacted into the Books of Esther / Judith

Fomenko [demonstrates](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html) how this story was redacted into the
modern Bible as the 'ancient' books of [Esther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther)
and [Judith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judith):

> In the Bible it is reflected as the 'massacre of the Persians'. To commemorate this event in the Judaic church the
> famous holiday of Purim was established. The story of Judith clearly shows the traces of the story of Esther already
> familiar to us. A foreigner, a Jewess, infiltrates the court of the 'Persian' king ( **Nebuchadnezzar Ahasuerus**),
> becomes his wife or an 'intimate person'. As a result a son or a close relative of the king – the
> king's co-ruler, tragically dies. It is followed by the massacre of the 'Persians' by the Jews. It is no coincidence
> that in the modern biblical canon the Book of Judith is placed next to the Book of Esther.
