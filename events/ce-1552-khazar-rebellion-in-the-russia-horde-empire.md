# Khazar Rebellion in the Russia-Horde Empire

Influenced by Protestant literature, Christians of the Crimea [convert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars#Judaism)
everyone in the Khazar court to [Messianic Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Judaism#Pre-19th_century)
and attempt to break away from the Rus-Horde Empire and form an independent Kingdom. The Czar-Khan Ivan the 'Terrible'
reacts and crushes the revolt ending the short-lived independence of Khazaria.

The name Khazar is also a transliteration of the name Katya / Katherine. The *annihilation* of the Khazars along with the
Cathars effectively ended the original Christian revolution started by Christ and Katya (who were long dead and buried).
Both cultures went [underground](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/virg/hd_virg.htm) and became heavily redacted in
History to the point of being denied by modern scholars, and yet in the Eastern religions today Katya is still worshiped
above all else (including Christ) -just under a different name-Mary Magdalene. Khazarian Judaism differed from modern
Messianic Judaism in many ways, most importantly that the Messiah, Christ i.e. King
Solomon the [Sun King](https://www.solarancestor.com/regular-blog-posts/-sol-om-on-a-sun-king), had *already* arrived.
