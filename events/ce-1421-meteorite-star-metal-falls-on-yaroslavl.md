# Meteorite (Star Metal) falls on Yaroslavl

In the year 1421, a meteor unexpectedly fell to the earth out of a fiery cloud
near [Yaroslavl](https://tmora.org/online-exhibitions/transcendent-art-icons-from-yaroslavl-russia/introduction-yaroslavl-city-of-the-bear/)
leaving behind a giant meteorite composed of heavy metals. The object was considered a holy relic, but the significance of
its arrival was unclear. Eventually the Hordian craftsmen experimented with the debris. They quickly found that when
used as an additive, a strong resilient steel could be smelted-the famous Damascus (i.e. Moscovian) [Bulat](https://pegasus-leaders.com/bulat/) Steel.

This invention gave the Rus-Horde Empire a new war advantage. Not only would the stronger metal cut through that of any
opposing army, but it offered a psychological advantage as well. The enemy would regard the metal itself as a gift from
the Gods, and a sign that They favored Rus-Horde crusaders. Later this story was
[reflected](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_26.html#the27) in the literature of Islam, Christianity, "Ancient"
Rome and Greece, as well as in [modern media](https://conananimated.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Metal). During their military
campaigns the Hordians and Atamans (Ottomans) carried the debris of the Yaroslavl meteor in a holy *arc* called Kaaba.
