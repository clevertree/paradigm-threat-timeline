# Meteorite (Star Metal) falls on Yaroslavl

In the year 1421, a meteor unexpectedly fell to the earth out of a fiery cloud
near [Yaroslavl](https://tmora.org/online-exhibitions/transcendent-art-icons-from-yaroslavl-russia/introduction-yaroslavl-city-of-the-bear/)
leaving behind a giant meteorite composed of heavy metals. The object was considered a holy relic, but the significance of
its arrival was unclear. Eventually the Hordian craftsmen experimented with the debris. They quickly found that when
used as an additive, a strong resilient steel could be smelted-the famous Damascus (i.e. Moscovian) [Bulat](https://pegasus-leaders.com/bulat/) Steel.

This invention gave the Rus-Horde Empire a new war advantage. Not only would the stronger metal cut through that of any
opposing army, but it offered a psychological advantage as well. The enemy would regard the metal itself as a gift from
the Gods, and a sign that They favored Rus-Horde crusaders. Later this story was
[reflected](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_26.html#the27) in the literature of Islam, Christianity, "Ancient"
Rome and Greece, as well as in [modern media](https://conananimated.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Metal). During their military
campaigns the Hordians and Atamans (Ottomans) carried the debris of the Yaroslavl meteor in a holy *arc* called Kaaba.

*Even the supporters of the traditional version admit that the Maid of Orleans began to be called *Joan of Arc* only from the second half of the xvi century. But this implies that in the duration of *more than a century* the heroine was called something else. The question is, what? According to our results she was called **Deborah**. Under this name she entered the Book of Judges. Then in view of the growing interest towards Joan, her other names and nicknames also fell into common use. And later, in the XVII-XVIII cc. the former name Deborah was gradually extruded from the story of Joan. The fact that Joan and Deborah is the same person was slowly forgotten. The 'biblical events' were pushed into the past, two thousand six hundred years back! The following generations of historians began to sincerely perceive Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah as two different characters. In our reconstruction Deborah = Joan of Arc lived in the epoch of the Ottoman conquest in the world of the XV-XVI cc. That is why the original geography of the events connected to her campaigns was much wider than the modern version.*
