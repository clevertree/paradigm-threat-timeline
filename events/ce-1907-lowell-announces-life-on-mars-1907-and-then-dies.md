# Lowell announces Life on Mars 1907, and then dies.

After making this announcement in the New York Times his health mysteriously and rapidly deteriorated.
He died from a stroke in the middle of World War One on November 12, 1916, aged 61 and is buried on Mars Hill near his
Flagstaff observatory.
Lowell's announcement had the power to change the world in *positive* ways that nobody could have foreseen,
but instead, his announcement was perceived as a threat by the controlling faction of the inhabitants of Mars.

![If Martians influenced War on Earth, it is logical that The Great War may have been *triggered or accelerated*
by Lowell's announcement of Life on Mars.
Shortly after this, World War I changed the world in *negative* ways
that [nobody could have foreseen](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/45966335).
The same humans who contrived the Great Wars of the 20th Century could not have done so
without first having consolidated power on Mars - otherwise a competing faction might have spoiled the various plots
over time. How could one faction wield so much influence?

## The Martian Catastrophe

It appears that in the late 18th century, humans on Mars were forced to intervene physically in Earthly affairs in order
to prevent the rebellion of Pugachev (1773) from spreading across the planet and destroying the authority of the
religious orders on Earth that Martians controlled
([Rex Bellator Plan](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bellator)).
The Martians fired large-scale
[Directed Energy Weapons](https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-directed-energy-weapons/)
at earth to reverse the accomplishments of the rebellion.
However, it appears that whoever decided to fire the cannons at Earth either did not fully understand the risks involved,
or did not care.
Either way, in a desperate bid to defeat Pugachev, the cannons may have been fired **too rapidly** resulting in a
**secondary discharge** as the energy passed through the Earth at the target point, and exited the Earth from a secondary
point elsewhere. Mars was in opposition at the time, and thus the energy fired at the Earth would largely return to
Mars and cause further damage. This is potentially the reason why
[melted city ruins](https://www.unariunwisdom.com/ancient-city-ruins-on-cosmos/cosmos/mars/) tend to be found on Mars.

Science 'Fiction' predictive programming suggests that life on Mars has not reached exhaustion due to being
*very ancient*, but rather as a result of their planetary ecosystem taking a massive hit during the
MudFlood Energetic Event.
Clearly the majority of Martians did not agree with nor benefit from this attack on Earth;
in every version of the story the instigator of the war
(Ender, Terl, Palpatine, Goa'uld System Lord, Xenu, Marvin, Shaddam IV, Senior Elder etc.) was deposed exiled and/or
executed. Nevertheless, the Martian catastrophe resulted in a major power vacuum on Mars and Earth allowing
the Deep State survivors to exploit the situation, consolidate power, and *deliver* from *'Egypt'*
(i.e. The destroyed Rus-Horde Kingdom) the loyal *chosen* bloodlines to the *promised land* to
repopulate the *reset* cities.
