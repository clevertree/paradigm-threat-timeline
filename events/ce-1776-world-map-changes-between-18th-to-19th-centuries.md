# World Map Changes between 18th to 19th Centuries

The 1773 Tartarian Rebellion was cataclysmic and devastating (Fomenko uses the word 'wreckage') because Pugachev
could not be defeated without destroying all the remaining strongholds loyal to the memory of the Russian Horde as well.
All the Hordian cities of Siberia, Africa, Zealandia, the Middle East, and the Americas were targeted, melted down, and ultimately buried.
To locate where these melted cities used to be, simply search google for a map of 'Gold mines around the world'.

  It shows the various colonies that existed at the time, as well as the *Island* of California
  and no sign of the Grand Canyon, or Colorado River or Rockies](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/map_california_island.jpg?w=360)

Before the rebellion, the Siberian Tartarian Kingdom still stood, along with mythical locations
(Shangri-La, El Dorado, Lemuria, Zealandia etc.).
During the rebellion, Siberia became the wasteland we know today, with all cities melted or buried, and only
the Romanov-controlled Moscow remained of the once great Empire.

There are quite a few world maps dated before the 19th century which differ significantly from later maps.
For example, in North America the state of California appeared as an island larger than the United Kingdom.
There is no sign of the Grand Canyon, or the 1400-mile Colorado River. In old maps of Hindustan,
the tributaries of the Ganges are significantly different, and there is no sign of the
1500-mile Himalayan Mountain range. Russia released maps from their historical archives of a vast Tartarian empire
in Siberia in 2014, in response to a coup in Ukraine. In maps of Tartaria, again
there’s no Himalayan mountains, Tibetan Plateau, or Great Wall of China. The land was inhabited, decorated with a
majestic balance of water, trees, and natural boundaries - nothing like the uninhabitable wasteland we know today as
Siberia.

#### The naming of Hollywood

If negative lightning scarring caused the creation of the Grand Canyon, it follows that the same negative energy would
behave differently around an island like California than it would in a plane like the midwest. It is possible that
during the MudFlood Event the island of California became fused to the mainland of America.
If this is what happened, then we can also guess at the inspiration for the name 'Hollywood'.
It might just be that the famous RedWood forest was the only forest of its kind (large trees) to
survive the event while all other forests were wiped out and in many cases
petrified. The island had redirected the secondary energy around its bulk and back out into space, protecting the
'holy' forest.
