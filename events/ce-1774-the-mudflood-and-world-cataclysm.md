# The MudFlood and World Cataclysm

The MudFlood Energetic Event was triggered as a result of the need to defeat the
[Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) in 1774.
The cause for the Rebellion itself was the attempts by the Romanov-controlled state to
disenfranchise Cossacks, serfs,
and tribal communities.
