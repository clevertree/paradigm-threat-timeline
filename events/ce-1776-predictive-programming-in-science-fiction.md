# Predictive Programming in Science Fiction

The MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis relies on the concept of *predictive programming* as a
primer for decrypting truth within media including controlled-opposition media. This theory (sometimes
called [Revelation of Method](https://exsplanet.blogspot.com/2009/12/revelation-of-method-predictive.html)) suggests
that Deep State agents deliberately leave hints of future events in popular fiction such as books, tv, movies, video
games, and news outlets. This is accomplished by the centralization of media, illustrated by Hollywood’s domination of
the world movie industry, and by categorizing something real as fiction, or something that isn’t real, as fact. The goal
of this method is to align public opinion with long term plans of the Deep State. Would-be dissenters of these plans
then tend to identify themselves early, allowing time for their opinions to be studied and an _official_
counter-narrative cultivated. This eventually leads to the public fighting each other and failing to find the real
culprit of their woes. [Michael A. Hoffman II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Hoffman_II) states:

> "The purpose behind the 'Revelation of the Method' is the implied consent of the populace. If no resistance is raised
> when they reveal the truth, the cryptocracy is free to continue to follow the satanic precept. 'DO WHAT THOU WILT IS
> THE WHOLE OF THE LAW.' In other words, when the cryptocracy reveals their evil manipulations and the MAJORITY of the
> people don't care, it's checkmate."
