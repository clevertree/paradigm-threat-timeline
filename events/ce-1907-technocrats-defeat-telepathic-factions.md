# Technocrats Defeat Telepathic Factions

The clue to an additional reason why it may have been possible for one faction to assume control over Mars is given in both the
movie Archon Defender and the PC game Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. In this predictive programming,
a planet endures a revolution as one faction that masters technology (but is devoid of spirit) wipes out all other
factions using a weapon that targets spiritual sensitivity i.e. telepathy or other energetic abilities.
If life on Mars was once largely telepathic (as implied by science fiction) it follows that all
factions which relied upon telepaths (who are sensitive to electromagnetic energy)
took a devastating hit in the MudFlood Energetic Event (MFEE) and never recovered.

> The uprising was a lie.
The epidemic was a lie.
The medical screening was a lie,
an excuse to identify the Shard Sensitive.
Then the disappearances started. - Archon Defender (2009)

> The Age of disillusionment and decay is Over.
I have never before witnessed a mass telepathic execution, but today, the remnants of our society have
displayed their disheartenment and desperation. - Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds PC (1998)

If this interpretation is correct, a question arises:
Did the technocrats who fired the cannons at Earth know that a *secondary discharge* would backfire and devastate
their own planet, essentially wiping out their *spiritual* rivals on Mars?
This answer may be why we see so many plots in science 'fiction' media that involve intelligent machines taking over
rulership of humanity; Terminator, Matrix, Wall-e, I Robot, Age of Ultron, Mitchells vs. Machines etc.
