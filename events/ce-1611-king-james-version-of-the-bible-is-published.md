# King James version of the Bible is published

In the last 2 centuries, the Rus-Horde Empire banned all publication of Reformation literature, including the English
translation of the Latin bible (1455 C.E.), but with the publication of the King James Version, the Protestant Bible
would finally be published and mass distributed throughout the world. The King James Version was different in
composition from the original Eastern Cyrillic bible which resulted in *further exasperation* of existing schisms of
religion, race, and gender.
[Corinthians 14:34](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/14/1-Corinthians-14-34.html) states:

> Let your women keep silence in the for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be
> under obedience, as also saith the law.

By combining the Old Testament Monotheistic religion with Gnostic Christianity, the central character Christ was merged
with the old saviour and became Je-Zeus i.e. Jesus. In this new version of the *Crucifixion* story, a class of people
known as the 'Jews' had *killed* the 'Son of God'. This [blood libel](https://www.levitt.com/essays/bloodlibel) inflamed
tensions between the common folk and the remnants of the ruling class of the Rus-Horde Empire known as Jews.
