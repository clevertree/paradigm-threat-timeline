# The Phantom Time Hypothesis

by Heribert Illig was published in 1991 and asserted that the Anno Domini dating system was fabricated by Jesuits
retroactively adding in a ‘phantom’ millennium of a thousand years to the timeline starting in the special year of
*AD1053*. Numerous authors such as
[N. A. Morozov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Morozov_(revolutionary)#Later_career_and_ideas)
 and [Anatoly Fomenko](https://chronologia.org/en) have
academically challenged the chronology of Scaligarian as well as Biblical history.
Both Catholics like St Jerome and Protestants like Joseph
Scaliger are accused of opportunistically reappropriating world history into a duplicitous
pro-European history within the last 500 years.

The New Testament was heavily redacted and translated from Cyrillic to Latin.
In the 19th century, conversion of the holy texts from Latin alphabet into indigenous languages caused mass illiteracy.
Eventually _Reformation_ historians made the case that Latin was the root of all languages.
The redaction of indigenous culture, science, history, medicine, and art into
Latin was remembered as the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.
Shared memories of world cataclysms became superstitious myths and religious prophecies.
The planet gods were forgotten, replaced by a new media-driven focus on Humanism, or as it’s known today, Communism.
The memory of the Rus-Horde Tartarian empire splintered into a false history of the *Roman* Empire,
the *Spanish* Empire, Samurai Japan, Manchurian China, Hordian-Cossack civilisations of America – Maya, Aztec and Inca
and others.

But our shared history is so spectacular that it’s not easy to invent a fake history to match. As the saying
goes _“You can’t make this stuff up”_. The 1995 movie The Usual Suspects demonstrates this concept - when covering up a
crime, the criminal will change the date of the events, the locations, even the names of the characters leaving the
causality of events intact. The worst crimes of history were pushed into deep antiquity or blamed on something else -
like a natural occurrence, or _terrorism_.
