# Jupiter catches on fire

Within 25 years, Gas-Giant Jupiter, still appearing on its coma-tail mountain, and having recently consumed Venus,
becomes fully exposed to the Sun's field and catches on fire for 20 straight years. Humans world-wide remembered this
epic spectacle as
[The Burning Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_bush) (Mosaic) or
[Chilam Balam](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/cbc/cbc15.htm) (Mayan)
and many others, even the Grateful Dead song [Fire On The Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pOKqcaR-A0). The
Old Testament story of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses)
redacts the planet saviour Jupiter (Zeus) into a mythical human prophet "Mo-Zeus" i.e. Moses who represents
a '[Universal Creator and Saviour God](https://sites.google.com/a/kent.edu/jwattles/home/comparative-religious-thought/judaism/moses-concept-of-god)'
. Under the changing influence of the gas giant, the Earth itself undergoes further cataclysm. In Hebrew and Egyptian
tradition, the Burning Bush was a sign that God (Jupiter) was unhappy with His creation (
Humanity). The Earth groaned, the ground vibrated, and a trumpeting sound was heard and _felt_ by every creature on the
planet up to [613](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments) times. Humans interpreted each exultation as a new
Commandment spoken directly by God. This became the basis of the 10 Commandments of
the [Mosaic Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_covenant).

This event symbolizes the end of King Jupiter's reign as well as a changing of the 'rules'. To most humans, Jupiter's epic
display meant once again that the _powers that be_ did not represent any gods. The **Deep State** reacts to this new
reality by creating the [Abrahamic Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_pieces)
replacing their direct rulership with indirect religious mind-control. In Genesis 22, the Bible story of
the [Binding of Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac)
describes the new rules of the Covenant. Abraham was originally called Abram which has the word 'Ram' in it. In this Old
Testament narrative, God ordered Abram to sacrifice his son Isaac as a test of loyalty. Abram complies and goes through
with the sacrifice until he is stopped by emissaries of the age of Aries (the Ram). These emissaries inform Abram that
he may slaughter a ram instead of his child, and he then does so under this new covenant. Going forward, subjects would
be ordered to sacrifice animals to show their loyalty to the **Deep State** and to its invisible god.
