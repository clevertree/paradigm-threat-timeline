# Before Creation

Ancient testimony from different civilizations seem to agree that there was no *history* (or time) before the
"creation" event. In all accounts, the time before the Golden Age was a lasting darkness. During this dark period,
Saturn's dwarf system was beginning to receive its first energy from the Sun, and with this energy came the first life
forms capable of having memory. As Saturn had not yet joined the Sun's orbit, there was no way to account for time.
