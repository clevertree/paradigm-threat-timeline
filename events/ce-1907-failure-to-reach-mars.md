# Failure to reach Mars

Half of (7 of 14) planetary robotic missions by NASA have been sent to Mars and
a Human Mission to Mars was in the official NASA plans since the 1950s.
Why then after 70 years are we no closer to an actual human mission?
The current most realistic earliest launch date
is [2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars#Current_intentions_by_nations_and_space_agencies)
with an extra 10 - 30 years to get there. How old will you be when they land?
Conspiracy Theorist Alex Jones was famously
[censored](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17659026/alex-jones-deplatformed-misinformation-hate-speech-apple-facebook-youtube)
after a caller suggested there could be
[A child slave-colony on Mars](https://www.thedailybeast.com/nasa-denies-that-its-running-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars).
The high-profile censorship of Alex Jones ended the discussion, and a controlled opposition agent Robert David
Steele was brought in to mis-represent the original claim.
“We actually believe that there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children who were kidnapped and sent
into space on a 20-year ride”.
The '20 year ride' version made the claim seem more like science fiction,
and caused readers to lend even less credibility to
the story, while hiding any mention of the true method of travel: instantaneous quantum tunnels like CERN.
In the original caller's transcript,
the caller described the children being *born* into slavery while on Mars. This makes more sense, and leads
the reader to assume there may be a break-away civilizations of humans living on Mars.

Former CIA pilot John Lear and former Lockheed L-1011 Captain said that NASA astronauts flew to Mars in 1966.
Moreover, Lear believed that astronauts had been preparing for this mission especially long.
They introduced certain drugs into the body, allowing people to adapt to Martian climatic conditions.
Allegedly, those astronauts could breathe rarefied Martian air,
so NASA had the opportunity to launch humans on the red planet for a longer time.
Jacques Vallee claims that Air Force Colonel Ron Blackburn told him in May 1990 that he was
“convinced the government is working on UFOs” and that non-human Alien "abductions" are
[simulated](https://prepareforchange.net/2020/07/11/forced-faked-alien-abductions-were-conducted-by-the-cia-according-to-renowned-researcher/).
Blackburn said that the chances were “pretty good” that the US government was “fooling” UFO witnesses “by
special effects developed by psychological warfare”. Vallee additionally states,
“I have secured a document confirming that the CIA simulated UFO abductions in Latin America (Brazil and
Argentina) as psychological warfare experiments.”

!["The Saturn Myth" by David N. Talbott, a book exploring the idea that
  ancient myths and religious beliefs were based on a different celestial configuration where
  Saturn, not the Sun, was the central figure in the sky.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/saturn/earth_was_saturns_moon5.jpg?w=360)

## Mars was Atlantis

According to [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html),
when Earth and Mars were still within Saturn's Orbit, Mars appeared above the Earth's North Pole
and was remembered as the 'island' of [Atlantis](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2018/05/03/36-atlantis-the-disappearing-homeland/)
*Yggdrasil*, *The Tower of Babel*, *Ladder/Stairway/Rainbow Bridge to Heaven*, *Garden of Eden*
and many other myths.
Above Mars was the plasmodial planet Venus which would continuously change shape forming star patterns and other symbols.
Fixed above Venus was the planet Saturn appearing as an immense ball (Baʻal) in the sky.
During this time, energy from the configuration penetrated the planets creating quantum entanglements
between the rocky planets Mercury, Earth and Mars. These entanglements were natural and stable.
It was possible to instantly travel between the gate points by walking through the gates.
Towards the beginning of the *Golden* age, there were no world empires, no kings, no war, no scarcity,
*"...and bird and beast and flower were one with man, and death was but a dream."* (Excalibur 1981).

There is no mention of the legend as Atlantis in any writer previous to Plato i.e. Homer, Pindar,
Herodotus, Aristotle etc.
In the [Timaeus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1572/1572-h/1572-h.htm), Plato describes Atlantis
as a continent (i.e. Mars) *nearly as large as the Earth* that appears at the destination point of a
traversable quantum bridge known by the Greeks as the *Pillars of Heracles*:

> “For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which,
starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe,
and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks
call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together;
and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands
to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here,
lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a
real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent.
Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power,
which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.”

![Authors such as N. A. Morozov and Immanuel Velikovsky
  suggested that ancient cultures may have viewed Saturn as a sun-like body](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/saturn/earth_was_saturns_moon2.jpg?w=360)

The priests of Atlantis regarded the immense planet-god Saturn as a sentient Creator God of the Universe,
and were remembered for distributing gifts and high technology to those who traveled to it on the quantum bridge
in exchange for obedience to the priest class that represented the authority of Saturn. According to Plato's
testimony, Atlanteans may have attempted to conquer Earth at some point during the Golden Age. If they had any
success, this may explain why they would attempt to restore the memory of an Empire later in the dark ages.
Additionally, Plato used the word 'insolent' which may suggest that the common people outside the
Atlantean/Monotheistic religion blamed the Atlanteans themselves for the end of the Golden Age, accusing them of
eating the forbidden fruit of the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil)
and bringing down the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel).
