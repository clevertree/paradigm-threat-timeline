# The Mysterious Carbon-14 Spike in 1063 B.C.E.

The 774–775 carbon-14 spike is an
[observed increase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/04/02/carbon-14-spiked-worldwide-over-1200-years-ago-and-the-sun-is-to-blame/)
of around 1.2% in the concentration of the radioactive
carbon-14 isotope in tree rings dated to 774 or 775 CE, which is about 20 times higher than the normal year-to-year
variation of radiocarbon in the atmosphere.
Based on the tree ring date of 774 CE, the actual date would be
(1154 phantom time discrepancy) - (774 by Scaligarian dating) = 379.
379 + (my estimate for end of cataclysm date 684 B.C.E.) = 1063 B.C.E.
Therefore at some time during the end of the cataclysmic dark age, a mass casualty event may have occurred on
Earth and Mars that dumped an excess of carbon into the atmosphere which got absorbed by trees.

The event appears to have been global, with the same carbon-14 signal found in tree rings from
Germany, Russia, the United States, Finland, and New Zealand.
Researchers went looking in the wrong year for a known event
that could possibly explain this increases and found this quote from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle:

> Annus Domini (the year of the Lord) 774. This year the Northumbrians banished their king, Alred,
from York at Easter-tide; and chose Ethelred, the son of Mull, for their lord, who reigned four winters.
This year also appeared in the heavens a red crucifix, after sunset; the Mercians and the men of Kent fought at Otford;
and wonderful serpents were seen in the land of the South-Saxons.

Adding the 'year of our lord' to 774 we get 1774 - the same date as the Rebellion of Pugachev that led directly to the
MudFlood Event. Was this 'red crucifix' in the night sky a sign of the weapon that was being fired from Mars?

## Results & Null Hypothesis

The MudFlood Energetic Event hypothesis is rejected if it is unable to solve the mystery of the MudFlood without
creating new uncertainties and contradictions. It must explain, for example, why so many cities are buried
(and sometimes melted), and why the event appeared to happen recently in the last few centuries.
It must also explain why the event was covered-up, and who benefited. It must also predict later events,
like the continued genocide and subjugation of the indigenous people worldwide,
the sudden emergence of the British Empire in the 19th
century, and the changing of world maps.
The hypothesis is rejected if the MudFlood was caused by something
other than humans on Mars, like non-human aliens or a natural disaster,
or occurred earlier than 1773.
It is also rejected if any of the dependent proofs and concepts are rejected, for example, if Fomenko's New Chronology
turns out to be *'wrong'*.

## Conclusion

The MudFlood Energetic Event (MFEE) Hypothesis posits that a
large-scale interplanetary energy attack triggered a catastrophic mud flood
and planetary surface reshaping on Earth in the late 18th century, starting around 1774,
culminating in a complete historical and societal reset.
The hypothesis attempts to solve such 20th century mysteries as;
the excavation of buried, melted, or mud-flooded cities;
the unexplained changes of world maps;
our inability to reach Mars;
strange CERN rituals;
repeating predictive programming themes in science fiction;
the creation of the Deep State;
the disappearance of the Human Giants;
and many others.
The [Earth History Timeline Reconstruction](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/history/chronology) provides a geopolitical foundation for explaining why the
Pugachev Rebellion of 1773 may have been so significant to world affairs, and why it may have triggered an apocalyptic
interplanetary genocide.
