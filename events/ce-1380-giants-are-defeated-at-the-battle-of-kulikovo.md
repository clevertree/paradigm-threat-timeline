# Giants are defeated at the Battle of Kulikovo

Giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology
of the smaller humans. In this battle, 'Royal' christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today
(Canonization). This is the 2nd great war between giants and smaller sized humans. It was also the moment the Giants
would lose all authority over the Rus-Horde Empire, and would become the permanent enemies of the state, enslaved and
eradicated. In this battle, the metal cannons were used to defeat fully armored giant warriors. The giants gave up
the fight after realizing the smaller humans had an undefeatable weapon. Apostolic Christianity and Judaism enshrined
this moment as the story of David vs Goliath where David beats a giant using a 'sling'.
This story was pushed back into history as the Battle of Marathon when 'javelins' were used to defeat the larger army.
