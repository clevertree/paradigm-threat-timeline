# 1380 C.E. Giants are defeated at the Battle of Kulikovo

Giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology
of the smaller humans. In this battle, 'Royal' christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today
(Canonization). This is the 2nd great war between giants and smaller sized humans. It was also the moment the Giants
would lose all authority over the Rus-Horde Empire, and would become the permanent enemies of the state, enslaved and
eradicated. In this battle, the metal cannons were used to defeat fully armored giant warriors. The giants gave up
the fight after realizing the smaller humans had an undefeatable weapon. Apostolic Christianity and Judaism enshrined
this moment as the story of David vs Goliath where David beats a giant using a 'sling'.
This story was pushed back into history as the Battle of Marathon when 'javelins' were used to defeat the larger army.

#### European Religious Schism Emerges

The Deep State learned during the Crusade that it can exploit religious schisms to trigger a war, and set upon
achieving the *next one*. As it operated behind the scenes in the new Kremlin capitol, it also
**controlled the opposition** by giving orders to scattered priesthoods in Western Europe to resist the Empire and
preserve Monotheism. In defiance of Christianity, Western Europe continued to
practice [ in secret](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sephardim#3) the Monotheistic religion of the Deep State. In
public, they engaged in unlawful [Dionysian orgy ceremonies](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html). The
Rus-Horde Officials were dumbfounded by this *heretical* behavior. They watched western *pagans* commit sacrifice
rituals and attempted to communicate and take orders from [invisible spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn).
In the next 2 centuries the local populations would start publicly
[burning heretics at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_burned_as_heretics) leading the Rus-Horde
empire to begin an [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) to find a peaceful solution.

  painted in Tuscany at the end of the 14th Century, devils shoot down arrows to inflict horror upon a tangled mass of
  humanity. Religious processions were commonly held during plague outbreaks in medieval Europe to provide succour
  against disease. During the Black Death of 1347–52, for example, a flagellant revival occurred, although this was
  condemned by church authorities as it descended into anti-clerical violence.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/apocalypse/black_death.jpg?w=384)

## 15th Century C.E. Ottoman Conquest of Europe.

The religious schism in Europe continued to grow into the 15th century with no clear solutions available.
Once again, this allowed the Deep State to exploit the situation laying the foundations for the *next war*.
They just needed to find a *good reason* to trigger it.

By the middle of the 15th century, the popularity of
Dionysian [orgies](https://vermiliongoldfishartblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/pompeii-pornography-power/) had led to the
widespread proliferation of transmissible disease. Knowledge of disease and medicine was still limited, and
superstitious populations would regard the spread of illness with suspicion, often exiling the sick. The Empire had a
serious problem and didn't know how to solve it. It was once again time for the **Deep State** to step in and take
advantage. The fear of wide-spread disease could be exploited to bring Europe into a new Crusade. They had the
*reason* to go to war-now they needed the *means*.
