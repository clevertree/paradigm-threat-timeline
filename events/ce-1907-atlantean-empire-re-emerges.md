# Atlantean Empire re-emerges

By the 19th Century, the Deep State was beginning to resurface to the
public, having defeated nearly all of its enemies in the MudFlood Energetic Event.
[London](https://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/cleopatra-s-needle-story-behind-obelisks-007051)
had a huge Egyptian obelisk moved there from Alexandria in 1877. After the American Civil War, an Egyptian
obelisk was constructed by slaves in [Washington D.C.](https://www.thewrap.com/spider-man-homecoming-washington-monument/)
in 1884 to commemorate George Washington, the guy who fought a war against London, where the *other obelisk*
stands. Even though the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause) of the US Constitution
prohibits establishment of religious icons within the government,
a [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States) with
an '[All-seeing eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence)' appears throughout the federal government
and on all United States $1 dollar bills.
How could two countries at war both have the same Egyptian
[obelisk](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/washington-monument-built-egyptomaniacs-180961314/)?
Because the Deep State was funding, arming, and directing both sides of every major [governance/war](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/cosmos/mars/governance/war) on Earth,
benefiting from its outcome.

could possibly deny...
the 20th century was entirely mine?
All of it! Mine.

Targeting [syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_syncretism),
both wars split the world along existing religious lines, segregating the mixed religions and
once again slaughtering the pagans. In particular, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism became separate identities
even as they continue to share the Old Testament as their primary book source.
20th Century genocides such as the Great Depression, Holodomor and Holocaust, and African Genocides resulted in
segregation of earth populations into controllable religious sects.

![The objectives of the covert tripod incursions were to co-opt and reassert control over the governments of Earth.
  What stories could not be kept hidden were instead published as 'science fiction'](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/cosmos/mars/wotw/wotw_album_cylinder.jpg?w=360)

## Redactions of the "War of the Worlds"

The story "The War of the Worlds" was a real event that occurred on earth many times.
It was heavily redacted by plagiarist [H.G.Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Deeks) in the book War of the Worlds (1898).
Until Wells stepped in, nearly all fictitious and non-fiction accounts of "Men from Mars"
regarded Martians as human men (and women) as well as benign.

> "H. G. Wells. His determination (utopianist though he was) to use Mars not for reassuring utopian
> fantasies but as a scourge to human complacency resulted in 1898 in a path-breaking novel of interplanetary
invasion.
> The War of the Worlds, the first literary masterpiece in the tradition of Martian fiction,
> upends the sentimental icon of the man from Mars and replaces him with monstrous would-be
> conquerors who give British imperialists a taste of their own medicine."
