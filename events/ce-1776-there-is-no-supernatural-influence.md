# There is No Supernatural Influence

We should only subscribe to scientific concepts that can be demonstrated *logically*, in a laboratory, or otherwise.
Real science is reproducible, reliable, and verifiable. For example, Saturnian Cosmology relies on the theoretical
foundation of the Electric Universe to correlate religious myths with interplanetary cataclysms seen in proximity
to the Earth by humanity. Mythical archetypes like the Thunderbolt of the Gods were then reproduced by the SAFIRE
project [in a laboratory](https://safireproject.com/project/genesis.html).

The word **God** comes from the word *good*, and **Devil** comes from the word *evil* - defined as the opposite of
anything good. Both good and evil are observed in nature and need no further influence. This hypothesis proposes that
the invisible ‘supreme being’ known as God is actually a human construct invented by the Deep State in ancient times,
and it benefited that same Deep State to keep up the divine charade this whole time. We are ruling out the influence of
invisible Gods, devils, bug-like / or otherwise repulsive-looking aliens, a Galactic Federation, Simulation Theory,
5th Dimension, Mandela effect, magic, prophecy, and time-travel.
