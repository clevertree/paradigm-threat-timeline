# Martian Tripod Incursions in Earth History

It seems that in every testimony of tripod incursions on Earth,
the event was followed by a major military conscription
in that same region, which then always leads directly to a major war.
The reason for the tripod incursion in London at the turn of the century was to
co-opt control of the British Isles and all of its world resources. By 1920,
the *British Empire* reached its greatest territorial extent.
There is a [statue of a Martian Tripod](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/martian-tripod.html)
in Woking town center, Surry, UK, one of the locations of these events.
In the U.S. East Coast, Orson
Wells [covered up](https://blog.newspapers.com/emwar-of-the-worlds-radio-scare-october-30-1938/)
yet another event involving Tripods.

The objective for the 1938 East Coast incursion was to conscript America and all of its world resources
into a world war against Russia. The American Empire reached its greatest territorial extent in 1945.
Science 'fiction' books have also depicted testimony of
[tripod incursions](https://marzaat.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/governance/war-of-the-worlds-global-dispatches/)
in the Civil War times. In “Night of the Cooters”, Sheriff Lindley organizes a resistance against
a Martian cylinder that lands nearby.
It's possible the Civil War would not have been accomplished without first eliminating major pockets of resistance
across america.


## Peace is the Final Reset

Our dystopian reality will continue indefinitely unless two things happen. Firstly, the Humans of Earth need to get
their act together and figure out what's real and what's not, regardless of what the actual truth is,
and that could take a while as much of the world still adheres to the cult of Monotheism
and believes an invisible god intervenes in modern events and has a 'plan for us all'.
This 'plan' of-course, turned out to be the Deep State's - requiring endless war and human carnage,
and could not possibly be something a benign deity would plan.
Therefore, the other event that has to happen is lasting peace on Earth.
If either of these two conditions are not met, it is guaranteed that this situation will continue.
As Samuel Clemens might say, the Deep State can rule some of the people all the time,
all the people some of the time, but never *all the people all the time*.
The Deep State has victimized humanity for thousands of years, but if peace is achieved on Earth then
all is forgiven. Humans on Mars may fear retribution, much like the Zionists fear retribution by Palestinians.
There won't be any. We already know how to share our resources.
There will be no scarcity (Malthusian theory was wrong, sorry Thanos!).
Mars will keep getting lovely supplies shipped from Earth.
They'll finally allow us to use advanced technology and give up their control, and peace will finally overcome
our **God of War**: The Planet Mars.
