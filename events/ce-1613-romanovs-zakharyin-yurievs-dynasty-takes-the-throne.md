# Romanovs-Zakharyin-Yurievs Dynasty takes the throne

In 1613, the Romanov dynasty, exploiting the disunity caused by the Oprichnina revolt, ascend to the throne-marking
the end of the old Russian dynasty whose bloodline leads back to their first Tsar-Andronicus Christ. The loyal and
defiant troops of the Hordian Empire were banished far from [Moscovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy). These
Cossack regions still exist today and represent the *legacy of Russia-Horde*. For example,
Kazakhstan === Cossack-Stan, i.e. a Cossack region.
