# 1196 C.E. First Crusade begins as Revenge for the Crucifixion

The *plan* works as intended as the humiliation of the crucifixion triggered a violent reaction especially in the
gathering Rus-Horde. Within 11 years, the Russians launched the First Crusade to capture the ‘Holy Sepulcher’ and take
revenge upon the crucifiers of Christ.

Not all Giants agreed with the Revenge Crusade. The older, wiser giants knew it was an obvious trap, and that two wrongs
*did not make a right*. However, the younger giants (up to 40 years old) were rash and began marching as soon as they
had the numbers. This first wave (remembered as
the [Children’s Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade) in the 13th century) fell for the trap and
were killed or sold into slavery. After this failure, the older giants got involved and drew more cautious plans to take
the holy Sepulcher and end the war.

The *Revenge Crusade* eventually turned religious as a new religion was forming around Christ and his mother Mary
(Katya). On the Trojan side, the ancient Deep State Bacchic goddess Aphrodite was worshiped. For this reason it is
remembered that the Trojan War was triggered over a woman. A decade of fighting ensues which sees the death of many
giants. The [Iliad](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/17439/what-does-branch-of-ares-mean-in-book-ii-of-the-iliad)
traces the lineage of some giants back to planet Mars where the [Jötunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn)
originated.

#### The First great war between giants and smaller sized humans

This is the first great war between human giants representing the Polytheistic 'Royal' bloodline Christianity descending
back to Christ and the 'apostolic' Monotheistic Christianity of the normal-sized humans. The War concludes in the Battle
of Troy/Jerusalem/TsarGrad with the giant humans winning. The story goes - the giants (Greeks) were having no luck
breaching the walls of TsarGrad (Troy), so they constructed a giant-sized wooden horse as tribute and pretended to flee
back to their homeland in Tartaria. The 'Trojans' brought the horse inside their walls seeing no threat, as the giants
could not possibly be hiding within, and they could not imagine that the giants had already gained the confidence of
the smaller humans to such a degree that the smaller humans would be willing to die on behalf of the giants in this
governance/war *against* giants, but such willing and revenging behavior was the direct result of the Crucifixion of Christ.

## 13th Century C.E.: The Russian Horde 'Tartarian' Empire emerges

Eventually the walls of Troy were breached, and the authority of the Monotheists was crushed. It wasn't difficult for
the Crusaders to convince the local population that their religious leaders did not speak for any God (s) as after
8 years no Gods had shown up to end the war. Swift [vengeance](https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/1118)
was committed upon anyone associated with the Crucifixion of Christ.
