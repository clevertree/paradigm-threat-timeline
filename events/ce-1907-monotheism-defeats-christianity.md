# Monotheism defeats Christianity

In 1380 C.E., the same lineage of Giants that founded the Rus-Horde empire were defeated at the Battle of Kulikovo.
Giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology of the smaller humans of that same empire.
In this battle, 'Royal' christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today (Canonization).
This is the 2nd great war between giants and smaller sized humans.
It was also the moment the Giants would lose all authority over the Rus-Horde Empire, and would become the
permanent enemies of the Deep State, enslaved and/or eradicated.
In this battle, the metal cannons were used to defeat fully armored giant warriors.
The giants gave up the fight after realizing the smaller humans had an undefeatable weapon. Apostolic Christianity
and Judaism enshrined this moment as the story of David vs Goliath where David beats a giant using a 'sling'.

Regardless, 'Apostolic' Christianity was generally unconvincing to the world at large,
and had to be reasserted through many bloody
[Christian Crusades](https://www.differentspirit.org/resources/crusades.php).
Polytheism became Paganism and all tails of the Gods would be re-written as purely human stories.
Some examples are the stories of both King Arthur and Jesus Christ
which are [allegories](http://solarmythology.com/lessons/christ2002.htm) for the Sun appearing to earth,
creating the first Seasons.
Publishing redacted pagan beliefs through mass media was the Deep State's primary subterfuge for
controlling humanity through religion.
