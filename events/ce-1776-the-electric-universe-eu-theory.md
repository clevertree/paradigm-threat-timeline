# The Electric Universe (EU) Theory

This [theory](https://www.electricuniverse.info) suggests that plasma physics played a central role
in the creation of our solar system (and all solar systems),
illustrated by primordial electric-scarring seen across the surface of our Moon and Mars.
The same types of negative [electric-scarring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1e5_tB6Y) also appears in a few locations on Earth,
like the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and may have been rendered not so long ago -
during the 18th century MudFlood Energetic Event.
The Electric Universe Theory also provides a scientific foundation for the Hollow Earth, the Young Earth, as well as the
Expanding Earth Models and effectively retires Meteor Impact/Crater Theories like the Alvarez hypothesis, Ancient
Dinosaur Fossils, and Uniformitarian Theory at large. Nevertheless, our children are still exposed to one-sided
scientific propaganda depicting a dead, chaotic, and meaningless universe - where virtually nothing is possible.

EU Theory is also the founding explanation for [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html),
an alternative to those of Uniformitarian (NASA) and Creationist models of the Universe. In Saturnian Cosmology
the planets in our solar system were the Gods of old polytheistic religions. They loomed closely in the Earth’s sky,
clashed with each other, and wrought devastating cataclysms in primordial times resulting in the _encrypted_ mythical
narrative we know today.

![“It is a direct sequitur from this that the planet is at present the abode of intelligent constructive life,
  I may say in this connection that the theory of such life upon Mars was in no way an a-priori hypothesis on my part,
  but deduced from the outcome of observation, and that my observations since have fully confirmed it.
  No other supposition is consonant with all the facts here.” - Percival Lowell, New York Times (1907)](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/mudflood/../cosmos/mars/mars_life.jpg?w=360)
