# Sept 6, 1666 C.E. London Burns to the ground

> This apparently & conveniently ended the distracting UK Bubonic Plague nationwide
> whilst the vatican corrupt canon law was conveniently sneaked in place uncontested
> benefiting Deep State secret societies - deeming all native sovereigns dead at sea
> removing the sovereignty & estate of each native sovereign at birth (via birth certificate)
> creating the secret "cestui que vie trust" account & all corresponding corruption
> removing man's status converting Master to Mr. - overriding law via deceived legal entrapment

> As well as loss of life, the financial costs were staggering. 13, 200 houses, 87 parish churches, The Royal Exchange,
> Guildhall and St. Paul’s Cathedral - built during the Middle Ages - was totally destroyed. The costs were estimated at
> £10 million.

> The relationship between the City and the Crown was often tense. The City of London had been a stronghold of
> republicanism during the English Civil War (1642 - 1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still had the
> potential to be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the
> early
> 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles
> I's
> grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.[13] They were determined to thwart any similar tendencies in
> his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other
> resources. Even in such an emergency, the idea of having the unpopular royal troops ordered into the City was
> political
> dynamite. By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was already out of
> control.
