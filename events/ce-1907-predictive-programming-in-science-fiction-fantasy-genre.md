# Predictive programming in Science Fiction / Fantasy Genre:

To understand the motivations behind *predictive programming*,
[transactional analysis](https://www.simplypsychology.org/transactional-analysis-eric-berne.html)
allows us to determine precisely what the viewer is being coerced into believing.
In other words, we ask: What do they want us to believe?
Or - what do they *not* want us to believe?
Since the great [book-burning](http://www.revisionist.net/book-burning.html) of the 20th century,
there has been a persistent trend in surviving published media that injects
[predictive programming](https://joyoffaith.com/predictive-programming.html) about
our reality into science fiction and fantasy movies. The idea behind this
coordinated programming is that the audience is expected to
understand that these two categories are strictly *fiction*.

![Common predictive programming themes found in science fiction that may reflect reality
  include the Martians need for Earth women, roman empire references, and the normalization of 'mutants'](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/influence/predictive_programming/marvin.jpg?w=400)

As a result of this trick, any information exchanged in a science-fiction novel or motion picture is
automatically regarded
by the viewer (and their entire peer network) as *untrue*. Any time a dogma of a science establishment
(like NASA) is challenged, the *programming* will kick in and the challenge will be categorically dismissed.
In addition, horrific images are often associated with 'SciFi' and 'Fantasy' media, especially in the 80s.
The same tactic is used by Christians who show their young children images of crucified adults.
*Fear is the most effective educational tool*.
All 20th century novels and [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_set_on_Mars) about
Mars describe it as unlivable and unattractive to Humans, and generally hostile to life. This is a major shift
from 19th century literature which describes Mars as being inhabited by
advanced humans who occasionally visit Earth on friendly terms.

#### Pyramid/StarGate Predictive Programming

The movie Star Gate (1994) attempts to categorically mythify the connection between real-life pyramids and
periodic star-gates into the realm of 'science fiction'
and highlights the persistent confusion among historians as to who built the pyramids and how and why they were
built. The movie differs from real-life by suggesting
'advanced technology' is required to build star gates. In real life, the pyramids themselves *were* the star
gates, and they did not function as depicted in the movie. In the very first scene of Star Gate,
during Daniel's Egyptology lecture,
a member of the audience laughingly suggests that _The Atlanteans_ as well as _The Martians_ built the Pyramids.
Well, this happens to be the truth.
However, This interaction is programming
meant to provoke the viewer into subconsciously considering and then
dismissing the possibility of pyramids being built for interplanetary
purposes by humans from _this_ solar system.

![The planet Mars has been removed over time from the role of antagonizer of science fiction plots.
  It has since been replaced by 'Ancient' or 'Galactic' aliens (much further away), or something else entirely.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/influence/predictive_programming/wotw.jpg?w=360)


Total Recall (1990) suggests there are pyramids on Mars built by ancient aliens. This programming negates the possibility
that Martian pyramids were built recently by humans. The movie also suggests humans explode when exposed to Martian
atmosphere. This common programming gimmick associates 'space exploration' with horrific images.
Total Recall (2012) is a remake of the original with the pyramids and nearly all references to Mars removed.
In Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005), the Red Planet itself was inexplicably removed from the traditional
storyline as well.
Why remove Mars from the classic Mars stories? The Deep State  still attempts to remove the breadcrumbs from the trail
that leads back to them. Due to this redaction, aliens in science fiction seem far more *ancient* and *distant*
while the idea of *martians* seem even more hokey.
