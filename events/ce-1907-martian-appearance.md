# Martian Appearance

Martians are *human*, like you and me. They aren't giant brains with octopus arms!
However, in the book they are described as such. Wells implies Martians somehow evolved over millions of years into
a far more primitive state. How could this be? We get a clue from another piece of predictive programming -
Independence Day (1996). In this movie, the *real* aliens are hidden within biomechanical host bodies
that do not resemble their actual appearance. The *host body* found in science fiction might have applied to the Wells book.
This would explain many things, like why the Martians do not appear to be human and how their bodies
could have survived the heat and impact of the physical travel between planets.

Martians live inside Mars, as all planets are Hollow, but life is difficult, food is scarce, and overpopulation
is an actual problem (unlike on Earth).
Contrary to programming, Martians are *not* smarter than Earthlings.
Their early adoption of advanced technology was motivated by the scarcity in their environment
and the need to control the flow of resources from Earth.

  This may have been a sign of yet another tripod incursion launched at Earth.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/cosmos/mars/wotw/wotw_real.jpg?w=260)
