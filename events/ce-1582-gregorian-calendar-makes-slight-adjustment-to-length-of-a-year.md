# 1582 C.E. Gregorian Calendar makes slight adjustment to length of a year

Since the end of the Dark Ages, the Earth's orbit around the Sun had slowed from 365.25 days in the 11th Century to
365.2425 days towards the end of the 16th Century. Protestants used this as an excuse to introduce the *Gregorian*
calendar in defiance of the Rus-Horde's [Lunisolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar) calendar. 13
months of 28 days (with leap months) changed to 12 months of uneven day counts. Months were renamed from *natural*
events, for examples: Feb5th-'Beginning of spring', Feb19th-Rain Water,
Apr5th-[Pure Brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival) into names from the false history of the
Roman Empire, for examples: January named after Janus, a war god that didn't
even [appear](https://www.andersonlock.com/blog/god-doors/) in the Greek Pantheon, March named after another God of
War-Mars, July named after Julius Caesar who is
a [redaction](https://catholicfundamentalism.com/similarities-between-julius-caesar-and-jesus-christ/22546) of Christ,
and August named after Augustus Caesar who was *also* a reflection of Christ. Most significantly, the Jesuits moved the Birthday of Christ 1053 years into the past to *zero year*.

## 17th Century-Romanovs Rise to power

The Oprichnina revolt dragged on into the 17th Century and was eventually put down by the Hordian dynasty-but
it was too late-the Protestants firmly had established themselves in the Horde's royal court backed by the Romanov
dynasty. Resistance of the remnants of Russia-Horde to their foreign rulers would continue to build up until the defeat
of [Pugachev's rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Rebellion) in 1775.

![The [King James Only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Only_movement) movement (also known as King James
  Onlyism) asserts the belief that the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is superior to all other translations of
  the
  Bible. Adherents of the King James Only movement, believe that the KJV needs no further improvements because it is
  the
  greatest English translation of the Bible which was ever published, and they also believe that all other English
  translations of the Bible which were published after the KJV was published are corrupt. Sometimes these beliefs are
  also
  based on the view that the King James translation itself was inspired by God.](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/reformation/king_james_bible.jpg?w=384)
