# Maintaining Control of Earth

Martians must also maintain strict loyalty within entire generations of humans here on Earth.
The Tripod Walker exists because the Martians need to hide their technology from Earth while attacking
it. Earthlings cannot build the Tripods themselves by observing them, as they lack the phenomenal electric power
required. In early versions of the War of the Worlds story, the Tripods show up and wipe out all living things with poison gas
while attempting to avoid destruction of infrastructure. The Martians then die of a disease (something they really
should have seen coming) and the story abruptly ends. The *real* story ends when the Tripods accomplished their
goal of disrupting a specific society, giving the insiders time to fill key positions of power before rebuilding
it again under the direct control of the *Deep State*. This may be why tripod incursions occur right before the major wars
of the last 2 centuries.

It's important to note that in the War of the Worlds story, the Tripods are observed taking away the remains of
their fallen comrades. Strategically, this is a bad idea as it leaves them open to a secondary strike.
The only reason they would do this is to hide the technology after the war is won,
leaving absolutely no trace of Tripods ever having been present. The survivors then get accused of
