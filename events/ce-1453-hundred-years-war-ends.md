# 1453 C.E. Hundred Year's War ends

The execution of Jeanne had backfired on the Deep State ending the Hordian war campaign and forcing them to change
tactics. They learned that they could not simply conquer Europe by force. It was also obvious that any attempt by the
Empire to spread propaganda or religion West would be met with the same resistance. There was only one solution left -
flip the script and **invade** the Rus-Horde Empire from the West!

#### Deep State Steals Russian History

On the Deep State's instructions religious clerics of Europe, after spending 200 years resisting Eastern Christianity,
suddenly would claim it for their own, changing the names, locations, and dates of the Eastern Cyrillic Bible into a
Western Latin version refashioning the stories with Western values. The Deep State saw this new tactic as a solution to
the failure of the Crusades in Europe. The Armies of the Rus-Horde Empire, operating at the behest of the Czar, had
no moral reason to conquer others and were easily demoralized. In contrast, the new Western Crusaders would eventually
call themselves [Warriors of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Warriors).
