# Deep State erases Russian Empire from all chronology

In an attempt to control the shards of the fractured Empire, the Deep State removed the Rus-Horde from *all history*.
To accomplish this, the chronology compiled by [Joseph Scaliger](http://scihi.org/scaliger-history/history/chronology/) was heavily
redacted, reorganized, and mass-redistributed by
Jesuit [Dionysius Petavius](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100319742)
in the [Opus De Doctrina Temporum](https://books.google.com/books?id=NYhEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover)
(1627). Fomenko [writes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html):

> Scaligerian chronology is being created making the dates of a great number of events artificially older.
> Joseph Scaliger (1540-1609) and Dionysius Petavius (1583-1652) are considered to be its creators. Though it is not
> very clear if in fact they were the authors of the works attributed to them or their names were cunningly made use of.
> Creating a *self-serving* version of history, the new authorities strove to prove their allegedly
> *'ancient origins'* and non-existent alleged hereditary *rights to the throne*.
