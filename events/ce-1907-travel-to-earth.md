# Travel to Earth

Despite what we've seen on Star Trek and Star Wars, space travel via 'spaceship' is virtually impossible for
living beings.
Earth's electro-magnetic field flows through our bodies and _keeps us alive_.
If we were to leave it, or get anywhere near the 'Van Allen Belts', we would die. Exposing one's self, or
space-ship to the Sun's EM field would mean certain death, regardless of size.
The only time it is safe to send a ship physically between planets is during opposition (every 26 months) when
Mars and Earth are joined by their extended EM fields. This creates a temporary tunnel of energy which protects
traveling craft and enables high-bandwidth communication. During each opposition,
the stock market [increases in activity](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/cosmos/mars/cosmos/mars/appendix_ares_le_mandat.pdf),
resources (human and otherwise) are transported, and remote-viewing (and control) is practiced.

Martians can also safely get to Earth via man-made Quantum Gates (like CERN) which only operate when the
planets are in opposition.
When Martians lose control over the gates, they lose control over Earth,
and they must use other means to reassert control remotely.
