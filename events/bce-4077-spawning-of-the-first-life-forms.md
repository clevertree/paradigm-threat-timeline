# Spawning of the First Life Forms

The memory of the moment of 'creation' shared by
[different mythologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creation_myths) was witnessed by life forms
that had *already spawned* and were capable of remembering it and recording it later during the Golden Age.
The [Younger Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda) states:

> And when the heated blasts from Muspelheim met the rime [of the rivers], so that it melted into drops,
> then, by the might of him who sent the heat, the drops quickened into life and took the likeness of a man,
> who got the name Ymer.

Every mythology (including the Bible) states that powerful forces in the sky spawned all life forms (including humans)
after its own image - an image which changed many times. As the Golden Age approached, the 3 southern plasmoids took on
different shapes, generating different animal energy patterns until finally the plasmoids formed the
[First Man](https://www.olivehackney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Year-5-History-and-Reading-Maya-Civilization-Creation-Story-Comprehension-with-Answers.pdf)
pattern. This ideal pattern in the southern sky provided the
[scalar](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000500240008-9.pdf) blueprint for spawning the first
humans.

#### Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation

The physics behind [Scalar Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-scalar-energy-negative-ion-robert-e-chan)
(aka [ZPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy)) can be applied to determine how the original species were
created in a high-energy environment *without* the need for evolution over many generations. Scalar Energy from
large electromagnetic fields causes [quantum fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) on single
points of space within the field. As the plasmoids in the southern sky took on a new energetic shape, quantum
fluctuations of energy upon the Earth forced similar energy patterns to generate within the inert matter (raw material
like metal or clay), and thus bringing the first animal forms to life. These primitive conscious entities, known as
[Golems](https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem) did not need to eat, see, or move about, in order to survive and thus
had no organs. This early 'Golem' form of life (including humans) then evolved organs throughout the Golden Age
as necessary.

## The Golden Age

This period of stable collinear configuration is remembered throughout the civilizations of the Earth as the *Golden
Age*. The Hindu Brahma, Yama, Vishnu, and Manu describe the age of the [“Brilliant Yima”](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/blog/blog-michael1.txt).
To the Chinese, it was the reign of [“Yellow Emperor” Huang-ti](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/china/huang-di.txt), founder of Taoism.
In Northern Europe, [Peace of Frodi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%B3%C3%B0i).
In the Christian Bible, this 930-year period was the [Garden of Eden](https://bennettleeross.com/history/intruder-alert-a-fast-approaching-brown-dwarf-star/).
In [The Myth of the Golden Age](http://www.ifiseeu.com/misc-ancient-myth/golden-age-myth.htm) 1997, David Talbott
describes Eden:


> "The world was quite other than what it is today: the trees were forever in fruit;
> the animals lived in perfect harmony, and the little Agouti played fearlessly with the beard of the Jaguar."

As each planet was connected [in-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Series_circuits),
their axial tilt would stay synchronized even as the entire system Orbited the Sun, but after the planets left the
configuration, each would connect to the Sun's environment **in parallel**
and their axial tilts would be fixed indefinitely. This is the reason Earth, Mars, Saturn, and Neptune have
matching [axial tilts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Solar_System_bodies) within 3 degrees. By the end of
this period, each planet in the configuration had become a "fully charged" capacitor, unable to accept more charge or
grow larger. The configuration violently came to an end, and the age of cataclysm began.
