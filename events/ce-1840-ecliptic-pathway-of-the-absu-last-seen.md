# Ecliptic pathway of the Absu last seen.

Jno Cook from SaturnianCosmology.org [describes the pathway](https://saturniancosmology.org/flood.php#flood-g34):

> The destruction wrought by Jupiter with plasma bolts in the asteroid belt (Hesiod's second battle) would have left
> dust and debris strewn along the ecliptic, causing the "path of the Gods" to be marked like a highway, defining the
> road
> of the Sun and the planets-- the zodiac. The lighted zodiac (the ecliptic) was last seen from Earth in AD 1840.
