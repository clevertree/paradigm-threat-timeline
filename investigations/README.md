# Investigations

Ongoing research to validate, correct, or deepen claims referenced in the paradigm-threat-timeline. Each investigation is a markdown file documenting sources, findings, and open questions.

**Note:** Mainstream sources may have redacted or altered original texts. We keep open the possibility that cited alternate sources are correct and that discrepancies stem from later edits, lost manuscripts, or scholarly misattribution.

## Active investigations

| Investigation | Status | Summary |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| [creation-dates-validation](creation-dates-validation.md) | In progress | Validate Jno Cook's claim that different civilizations had different creation dates (5969 BC, 5872 BC, 5508 BC, etc.). |
