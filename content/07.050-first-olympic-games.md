# First Olympic Games

In memory of the religious plurality that followed the Crusades the Olympic Games would be held every 4 years throughout
the Empire. Coliseums were built to host the events in western states like France, Italy, Tunisia, and Croatia. They
were never used for gladiator fights which mostly occurred
on [public squares](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC013EN.html) outside the boundaries of imperial law.
