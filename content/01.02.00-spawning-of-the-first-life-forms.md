# Spawning of the First Life Forms

![Spawning of the First Life Forms](/media/01.before-creation/spawning-first-life-forms.png)

The memory of the moment of 'creation' shared by
[different mythologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creation_myths) was witnessed by life forms
that had *already spawned* and were capable of remembering it and recording it later during the Golden Age.
The [Younger Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda) states:

> And when the heated blasts from Muspelheim met the rime [of the rivers], so that it melted into drops,
> then, by the might of him who sent the heat, the drops quickened into life and took the likeness of a man,
> who got the name Ymer.

Every mythology (including the Bible) states that powerful forces in the sky spawned all life forms (including humans)
after its own image — an image which changed many times. As the Golden Age approached, the 3 southern plasmoids took on
different shapes, generating different animal energy patterns until finally the plasmoids formed the
[First Man](https://www.olivehackney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Year-5-History-and-Reading-Maya-Civilization-Creation-Story-Comprehension-with-Answers.pdf)
pattern. This ideal pattern in the southern sky provided the
[scalar](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000500240008-9.pdf) blueprint for spawning the first
humans.

The first life forms — [Golems](https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem) — were not shaped from rock or common clay,
but condensed from a dense, mercury-like liquid metal by the sustained scalar field of the Saturnian system.
See [Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation](/content/01.02.01-scalar-energy-as-the-basis-of-creation.md) for the
detailed mechanism of how scalar energy reorganized this conductive metallic mass into living forms, and how organs
gradually developed throughout the Golden Age as the metal transmuted into biological tissue.

## The First Man Pattern: Plasmoid as Blueprint

As the 10,900 BC–8347 BC period of the Peratt Column wound down, the three southern ball plasmoids cycled through
a sequence of morphological forms before extinguishing — including the **squatting man** / standing humanoid figure
that Peratt's analysis of 4,000,000 petroglyphs identified as the most widely reproduced image in human prehistory.

This is the "First Man" encoded in myth worldwide — not an ancestor, but the plasma template from which the first
humans were physically formed out of mercury-like liquid metal:

- **Hebrew**: Adam Kadmon — the primordial cosmic human whose body was the template for creation; the Golem tradition
  preserves the memory of a being shaped from base matter and animated by divine force
- **Hindu**: Purusha — the cosmic man from whose dismembered body the universe was constructed
- **Vedic/Mesoamerican**: the squatting deity of lightning and sky (Huracan / God K)
- **Norse**: Ymer — born of the heat from Muspelheim (the southern plasma column) meeting the rime of the rivers;
  the Edda's description of drops "quickening into life" precisely describes a liquid metallic substance animated
  by plasma energy

The Younger Edda's description of Ymer is a direct mythological encoding of the plasma mechanism: the heat from the
southern column (Muspelheim) ionizes the cold primordial waters, and from the charged plasma drops *life quickens*
into the likeness of a man. This is not allegory. It is a description of an observed sky event and its interpreted
biological consequence, preserved in oral tradition for thousands of years.

## Homo sapiens and the Upper Paleolithic Revolution

The abruptness of the Upper Paleolithic transition — what archaeologists James Shreeve and others have called a
revolution with no precedent — is fully consistent with an external speciation event rather than internal evolutionary
pressure. Cook summarises:

> *"We, Homo sapiens, did not slowly evolve from these hominids. When we do finally appear, it is complete and with
> astounding suddenness — and with hundreds of specific stone tools, spear throwers, detachable harpoons, serrated
> knives, thread cutters, basketry, weaving, beads, and cosmetics."*
> — Jno Cook, [Chapter 7: Ice Ages and Humans](https://saturniancosmology.org/ice.php)

The conventional "out of Africa" hypothesis — driven largely by political considerations according to geneticist
R. A. Fonda — cannot account for the simultaneous global appearance of the same material culture package.
A plasma speciation event of sufficient intensity, acting on dispersed *H.erectus* populations across Northeastern
Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa simultaneously, produces the observed pattern: multiple independent origin points,
rapid spread, rapid elimination of competing species, and an immediate, fully-formed cultural explosion.
