# From Missionaries to Corporations: The 20th Century Succession

The operational logic of the Jesuit missionary pattern — infiltrate through culture, document resources and vulnerabilities, create a pretext for intervention, consolidate power — survived intact into the 20th century. Only the actors changed: where Jesuits carried the Bible, their successors carried development aid, linguistic research grants, and CIA credentials.

## The Missionary-to-Intelligence Pipeline

The continuity was not metaphorical. The same skills were required: linguistic fluency, cultural immersion, trust-building, intelligence gathering, and remote operation. The 20th century version dropped the religious pretext and made intelligence objectives explicit.

### SIL International

The most direct successor was the [Summer Institute of Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_International) (SIL, founded 1934). SIL linguists embedded in indigenous communities, documented languages, mapped territories, and catalogued resources. In multiple cases — [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Auca), [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide), [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Peru), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figueiredo_Report) — this intelligence was shared with military and corporate interests. The pattern: (1) linguists build trust, (2) first reliable maps and resource inventories created, (3) information flows to government/corporations, (4) extraction or military operations follow, (5) the community is dispossessed.

### Guatemala: The Full Arc

The [1954 CIA-backed coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) against Jacobo Árbenz followed the missionary pattern precisely: "wicked Indians" became "Communists"; military intervention "saved" a country from itself. The [Guatemalan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide) (1981–83, ~200,000 Maya killed) was the terminal consequence of a pattern begun by Jesuit missionaries five centuries earlier.

### Brazil and the Amazon

The 1967 [Figueiredo Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figueiredo_Report) documented systematic enslavement, land theft, and biological warfare against indigenous communities. Many initial contacts had been established through missionary channels. Logging, mining, and ranching followed the mission trails, as colonial administrators had followed Jesuit stations in earlier centuries.

## Liberation Theology: The Jesuits' Own Rebellion

[Liberation Theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) (1960s–80s) represented the Jesuit order *turning against its handlers*. After five centuries as the vanguard of empire, a faction recognised the pattern. The six Jesuits [massacred at UCA El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_murders_of_Jesuits_in_El_Salvador) in 1989 by US-trained soldiers attempted to break it. The Vatican systematically suppressed Liberation Theology — mirroring the [original 1773 suppression](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.01.00-1718-ce-secret-society-of-jesus-goes-public.md): when the order acts independently of imperial interests, it is brought to heel.

## The Protestant-Intelligence Axis

While the Catholic tradition produced Liberation Theology — a rebellion of conscience — the Protestant missionary tradition produced a seamless fusion of evangelism, anti-communism, and intelligence operations. Unlike Jesuits, who attempted to understand target communities, many Protestant missions had no interest in indigenous knowledge. The Protestant approach — from Scaliger's chronology to 20th century missions — was never interested in indigenous claims, only in replacing them with a predetermined narrative.

This has consequences for historical reconstruction: the Jesuit archive contains irreplaceable records of pre-colonial cultures; the Protestant archive largely does not.

## The Pattern Endures

The Jesuits remain a respectable organisation, in many cases genuinely benevolent. Their tragedy is not malice but *instrumentalisation* by forces they didn't fully understand. They were misguided, not malicious — and they wrote down the truth even while trying to overwrite it. Their archive is invaluable.
