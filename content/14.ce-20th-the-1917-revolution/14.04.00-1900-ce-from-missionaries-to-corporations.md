# From Missionaries to Corporations: The 20th Century Succession

The 20th century completed the transformation of the Jesuit missionary pattern into its final, secular form. The operational logic — infiltrate a community through culture, document its resources and vulnerabilities, create a pretext for external intervention, and consolidate power — survived intact. Only the institutional actors changed. Where Jesuits had once carried the Bible and the cross, their successors carried development aid, linguistic research grants, and CIA station credentials.

The Jesuits themselves continued to operate throughout the 20th century, but the cutting edge of the infiltration mission had passed to new organizations: evangelical Protestant missions, [Bible translation societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wycliffe_Bible_Translators), anthropological research teams, and the constellation of intelligence-linked NGOs that proliferated after World War II. The missionaries laid the foundations; the corporations and CIA affiliates moved in to consolidate power and resources.

## The Missionary-to-Intelligence Pipeline

The operational continuity between 19th century Jesuit missions and 20th century intelligence operations is not metaphorical. The same skill set was required: linguistic fluency, cultural immersion, trust-building, intelligence gathering, and the ability to operate in remote communities for extended periods. The difference was that the 20th century version dropped the religious pretext (or replaced it with an evangelical Protestant one) and made the intelligence and resource objectives explicit.

### The Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL International)

The most direct successor to the Jesuit missionary intelligence model was the [Summer Institute of Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_International) (SIL), founded in 1934 by [William Cameron Townsend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cameron_Townsend). Originally called the Wycliffe Bible Translators — named, notably, after the Protestant reformer John Wycliffe, not a Catholic saint — SIL's stated mission was to document unwritten indigenous languages in order to translate the Bible into them.

The operational reality was more complex. SIL linguists embedded in indigenous communities across Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific, achieving the same deep cultural access that Jesuit missionaries had pioneered centuries earlier. They documented languages, mapped territories, catalogued resources, and created the first reliable intelligence about communities that had resisted contact with the outside world. In multiple documented cases — particularly in [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Auca), [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide), [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Peru), and [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figueiredo_Report) — this intelligence was shared with or accessible to military and corporate interests.

The pattern was the Jesuit pattern, updated for the 20th century:
1. Linguists/missionaries establish trust in indigenous communities
2. They create the first reliable maps, population counts, and resource inventories
3. This information flows to government agencies and corporate entities
4. Development projects, extraction operations, or military actions follow
5. The indigenous community that trusted the missionaries finds itself dispossessed

### Guatemala: The Pattern in Full

Guatemala provides the most fully documented case of the missionary-to-corporate pipeline. Catholic and Protestant missionaries had been present among the Maya since the 16th century (see [Jesuit Operations: Conversion, Catholicism, and the New World](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.04.00-jesuit-operations-conversion-and-catholicism.md)). By the 20th century, the institutional successor was the [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company), which did not bother with religious conversion but operated with the same colonial logic: document the territory, control the population, extract the resources, and call in military force when the population resists.

The [1954 CIA-backed coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) against the democratically elected government of Jacobo Árbenz — whose land reform threatened United Fruit's holdings — followed the missionary pattern with perfect precision. The "wicked Indians" of the Jesuit era had become "Communists"; the military intervention to "save" missionaries had become an intervention to "save" a country from itself; the colonial administration had become a corporate-military junta.

The [Guatemalan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide) of 1981–1983, in which an estimated 200,000 Maya were killed by the US-backed military government, was the terminal consequence of a pattern that began with Jesuit missionaries walking into Maya communities five centuries earlier carrying the Bible and a genuine curiosity about Maya cosmology.

### Brazil and the Amazon

In the Brazilian Amazon, the pattern continued into the late 20th century. SIL missionaries and Catholic mission stations (including Jesuit ones) served as the primary points of contact with uncontacted or semi-contacted indigenous groups. The 1967 [Figueiredo Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figueiredo_Report) — a Brazilian government investigation into the country's own Indian Protection Service — documented systematic abuses including enslavement, land theft, and biological warfare against indigenous communities. Many of the initial contacts that made these abuses possible had been established through missionary channels.

The infrastructure of contact — airstrips, mission stations, bilingual indigenous translators trained by missions — was repurposed for resource extraction. Logging, mining, and cattle ranching followed the missionary trails into the interior, just as colonial administrators had followed Jesuit mission stations in earlier centuries.

## Liberation Theology: The Jesuits' Own Rebellion

The most remarkable development of the 20th century Jesuit story was [Liberation Theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) — a movement that emerged in Latin America in the 1960s–1980s, primarily among Jesuit and Franciscan clergy, which argued that the Gospel demanded *political action against poverty and oppression* rather than acceptance of colonial and corporate power structures.

Liberation theologians like [Gustavo Gutiérrez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Guti%C3%A9rrez), [Jon Sobrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Sobrino), and the six Jesuits [massacred at the University of Central America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_murders_of_Jesuits_in_El_Salvador) in El Salvador in 1989 by US-trained soldiers represented the Jesuit order *turning against its handlers*. After five centuries of serving — knowingly or unknowingly — as the vanguard of empire, a significant faction of the Society of Jesus recognized the pattern and attempted to break it.

The Vatican under [John Paul II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II) and [Benedict XVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI) systematically suppressed Liberation Theology — silencing its proponents, closing its seminaries, and replacing its bishops with conservatives. The suppression of Liberation Theology in the 1980s–1990s mirrors, with uncanny precision, the original [suppression of the Jesuits in 1773](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.01.00-1718-ce-secret-society-of-jesus-goes-public.md): the moment the order began to act independently of imperial interests, it was brought to heel.

## The Protestant-Intelligence Axis

While the Catholic Jesuit tradition produced Liberation Theology — a rebellion of conscience — the Protestant missionary tradition produced something very different: a seamless fusion of evangelical Christianity, anti-communism, and intelligence operations.

The [Gospel Missionary Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant_Ministries), [New Tribes Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnos360), and dozens of smaller evangelical organizations operated throughout Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia during the Cold War with objectives that were indistinguishable from intelligence gathering. Unlike the Jesuits, who had a centuries-old tradition of intellectual seriousness and at least attempted to understand the communities they entered, many Protestant missions had no interest in indigenous knowledge, history, or claims. Their objective was conversion — full stop — and their operational product was access and information.

This distinction — between the Jesuit tradition of *documentation with conversion* and the Protestant tradition of *conversion without documentation* — is not theological trivia. It has direct consequences for the reconstruction of history. The Jesuit archive, accumulated over four centuries across five continents, contains irreplaceable records of indigenous cultures as they existed before colonial destruction. The Protestant missionary archive, by and large, does not. The Protestant approach to history, from Scaliger's chronology to 20th century evangelical missions, was never interested in what indigenous peoples knew or claimed. It was interested in replacing what they knew with a pre-determined narrative — exactly as the [Scaligerian chronology](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.04-1627-ce-deep-state-erases-russian-empire-from-all-chronology.md) had replaced actual historical records with a fabricated timeline.

## The Pattern Endures

As of the 21st century, the missionary-to-corporate pipeline continues in evolved forms. NGOs, development agencies, climate research organizations, and "capacity building" programmes serve the same function that Jesuit missions served in the 16th century: establishing presence in remote communities, documenting resources and social structures, building local dependency on external support, and creating the conditions for subsequent commercial or political penetration.

The Jesuits — the original operatives — remain a respectable organization, and in many individual cases a genuinely benevolent one. The tragedy of the Jesuit story is not that they were evil but that they were *instrumentalized* by forces they didn't fully understand for purposes they would have rejected had they seen the full picture. They were misguided, not malicious. They wrote down the truth of what they found even while trying to overwrite it with Catholic doctrine. For this, their archive is invaluable, and their intellectual legacy, despite everything, deserves respect.

The Protestants who built the alternative — the Scaligerian timeline, the evangelical conversion machine, the intelligence-missionary hybrid — deserve no such respect. They were not interested in truth. They were interested in power. And the version of history they bequeathed to the modern world is the most corrupt, most cynically detached, and most mathematically indefensible chronological framework ever constructed.
