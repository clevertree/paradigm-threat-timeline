# Soviet Historiography: The Final Falsification Layer

## The Construction of Official History

After the revolution, the Soviet state did not merely censor history — it **manufactured** it. A new class of Party-approved historians was tasked with rewriting the entire Russian past according to Marxist periodisation:

- **Primitive communism** → Slavic tribal period
- **Feudalism** → Kievan Rus through the "Tatar-Mongol yoke" and Muscovite period
- **Capitalism** → 19th century industrialisation
- **Socialism** → The October Revolution and Soviet state

Every event, every figure, every institution in Russian history was forced into this schema. Events that did not fit were downplayed, reinterpreted, or eliminated from the record. The Marxist stages of history were not a theory to be tested — they were a **template** to be imposed.

## The Destruction of Archives

The physical destruction was systematic:

**Churches and Monasteries:**
- Approximately 50,000 churches were destroyed or repurposed between 1917 and 1941
- Monastic libraries — the oldest repositories of Slavic manuscripts — were dispersed, many destroyed
- The Solovetsky Monastery, which held one of the largest manuscript collections in Russia, was converted to a labour camp (1923)

**Aristocratic Archives:**
- Estate libraries were nationalised and in many cases destroyed during the chaos of the Civil War
- Family papers, genealogies, and correspondence going back centuries were burned or lost
- The systematic destruction of the aristocracy meant the destruction of their documentary heritage

**Village Records:**
- The *obshchina* maintained oral traditions and local records of land use, governance, and community life
- Forced collectivisation destroyed the communes and scattered their members
- By 1940, the organic village structure that had preserved local memory for centuries was gone

**Academic Archives:**
- Universities were purged of "bourgeois" scholars
- Research that contradicted Marxist orthodoxy was suppressed
- Nikolai Morozov — whose chronological research anticipated Fomenko's — was released from prison only to see his work marginalised by the new regime

## Mikhail Pokrovsky and the Marxist School

The key figure in early Soviet historiography was Mikhail Pokrovsky (1868–1932), who served as de facto head of Soviet historical science from 1918 until his death. Pokrovsky's approach was crude but effective: Russian history was to be understood entirely through the lens of class struggle. There were no great men, no spiritual forces, no civilisational patterns — only the mechanical grinding of economic classes against each other.

After Pokrovsky's death, Stalin's regime paradoxically rehabilitated certain nationalist themes (Ivan the Terrible became a hero, Alexander Nevsky a patriot), but the underlying Marxist framework remained. The Stalinist correction was not a return to truth — it was a **second layer of falsification** applied on top of the Pokrovskian layer, which was itself applied on top of the Romanov layer.

## Ivan Kinkel and the Road Not Taken

Against this backdrop, Kinkel's theory of civilisational development — with its biological metaphors, its cyclical patterns, its insistence on the interconnection of economic, spiritual, and cultural life — represents the **road not taken** in Russian economic thought.

Had the revolution not occurred — or had it produced a different kind of regime — scholars like Kinkel might have developed their theories within the Russian academic system. Their work might have provided an alternative framework for understanding Russian history that was neither Marxist nor Scaligerian, but rooted in the organic patterns of civilisational development that Russia's own experience exemplified.

Instead, Kinkel's work was suppressed for half a century. His books were removed from Bulgarian libraries after 1944. His ideas were mocked as "kinkeliads." And the theoretical space he might have occupied — the space for a non-materialist, non-reductionist understanding of economic and civilisational development — was left vacant.

## The Layers of Falsification

From the New Chronology perspective, the Russian historical record has been subjected to at least four distinct layers of falsification:

1. **Scaligerian layer (16th–17th century):** The creation of the false long chronology by Scaliger and Petavius, adopted by the Romanovs to legitimise their rule
2. **Romanov layer (17th–19th century):** The systematic destruction of Hordian documents and the importation of German historians to construct a "proper" Russian history
3. **Pokrovskian/Marxist layer (1918–1932):** The rewriting of all Russian history as a Marxist class-struggle narrative
4. **Stalinist layer (1932–1953):** Selective rehabilitation of nationalist themes within the Marxist framework, creating a hybrid falsification

Each layer was applied by a regime with different motives but converging effects: the deeper past — the Hordian past, the real structure of pre-Romanov civilisation — became progressively more difficult to recover.

Soviet historiography was not the origin of the falsification. It was the **final coat of paint** on a structure that had been under construction for 300 years. But it was the coat that sealed everything beneath it, because the Soviet regime, unlike its predecessors, had the totalitarian apparatus to enforce a single version of history across an entire continent for seventy years.

## The Aftermath

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the archives were partially opened. Fomenko's New Chronology, which had been developing quietly since the 1970s, finally reached a wider audience. Scholars like Nenovsky began recovering the work of suppressed thinkers like Kinkel.

But the damage was done. Three generations had been educated exclusively within the Marxist-Scaligerian framework. The primary sources that might have validated alternative chronologies had been destroyed or dispersed. The intellectual traditions that might have provided alternative frameworks had been in exile for seventy years.

What remains is reconstruction from fragments — which is precisely what the New Chronology attempts.
