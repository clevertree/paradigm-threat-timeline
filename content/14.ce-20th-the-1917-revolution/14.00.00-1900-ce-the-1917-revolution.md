# 20th Century: The 1917 Revolution and the End of the Horde

The early 20th century brought the fulfilment of Marx's prophecy — or rather, the execution of the script. In 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution swept away the Romanov dynasty and, with it, the last institutional connections to the old Rus-Horde. The royal family was allegedly executed in Yekaterinburg in 1918, though no definitive proof of their deaths has ever been produced. What is certain is that an entire civilisation was incinerated: its churches, its documents, its communal land systems, its aristocratic memory-keepers, and its independent scholars.

This chapter examines the 1917 revolution not as the triumph of the proletariat but as the **final act of a centuries-long campaign** to destroy the remnants of the world-empire described in Fomenko's New Chronology. The Romanovs had begun the demolition in 1613 by seizing the throne. The 19th-century ideologues had provided the blueprint. The Bolsheviks merely finished the job.

## What Was Really Destroyed

The revolution did not merely change political systems. It systematically destroyed:

- **The Russian Orthodox Church** — keeper of manuscripts, genealogies, and liturgical traditions linking Russia to the old Hordian imperial church
- **The aristocratic families** — descendants (however distant) of the Hordian vassal governors
- **The village communes** — the last functioning remnant of Hordian collective governance
- **The old document archives** — millions of records burned, seized, or reclassified
- **The independent intellectual class** — exiled, executed, or forced into ideological conformity

This was not collateral damage. It was the objective.

## Key Events Covered
