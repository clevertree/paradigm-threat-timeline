# The Bolshevik Revolution: Fulfilment of the Script

## February 1917: The Last Romanovs Fall

In February 1917, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. The official narrative presents this as a spontaneous uprising of war-weary workers and soldiers. The New Chronology perspective sees something different: the final collapse of the usurper dynasty that had ruled since 1613. The Romanovs were not the ancient line they claimed to be. They were the Zakharyin-Yuriev family — Western-aligned interlopers who had illegally seized the Hordian throne, falsified 300 years of backwards-projected history, and systematically dismantled the old world-empire.

By 1917, the Romanovs had served their purpose. The empire was fragmented. The old memories were fading. The document archives had been sifted and sanitised across three centuries. The dynasty was now expendable — and expendable is what it became.

## October 1917: The Bolsheviks Execute the Plan

The October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power under Lenin's leadership. What followed was the systematic application of the Marxist demolition script:

**Phase 1: Destroy the Church.** Thousands of churches were demolished, repurposed, or sealed. Manuscripts were burned. Icons were melted for gold. Monks and priests were shot or sent to camps. The Russian Orthodox Church — whatever its later corruptions — was the institutional repository of the oldest surviving textual traditions linking Russia to its Hordian past. Its destruction was not anti-religious sentiment. It was **archive destruction**.

**Phase 2: Destroy the Aristocracy.** Former nobles, large landowners, and their families were executed, exiled, or assigned to forced labour. These were the families — however degenerate by 1917 — who carried genealogical memory of the old provincial governance system. Their papers, their family archives, their oral traditions: all eliminated.

**Phase 3: Destroy the Communes.** The *obshchina* was abolished. Collective agriculture was replaced first by forced grain requisition (War Communism, 1918–1921), then by the catastrophic forced collectivisation of the late 1920s under Stalin. The village communes — the last living cells of Hordian collective governance — were replaced by state-managed collective farms (kolkhozes) that bore no organic connection to the communities they replaced.

**Phase 4: Construct a New History.** Soviet historians, under strict Party control, created the final layer of historical falsification. Russian history before 1917 was rewritten as a Marxist morality tale of feudalism, capitalism, and class struggle. The Hordian period was preserved as the humiliating "Tatar-Mongol yoke." The pre-Romanov era was further obscured behind layers of Marxist periodisation. And the New Chronology perspective — which Fomenko would develop decades later — was made structurally impossible to discover, because the primary sources had been destroyed or locked away.

## The Alleged Execution of the Royal Family

On the night of 16–17 July 1918, the Romanov family — Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their five children — were allegedly executed by a Bolshevik firing squad in the basement of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg.

The evidence for this event is remarkably thin:

- The bodies were not found until 1991 — 73 years later — and only after the collapse of the Soviet Union
- DNA identification has been contested by multiple researchers
- The original investigation (by Nikolai Sokolov, a White Russian) was conducted under the chaotic conditions of the Civil War and relied heavily on circumstantial evidence
- Multiple credible reports of Romanov family members surviving the execution circulated for decades
- The Russian Orthodox Church initially refused to accept the remains as authentic

None of this proves the Romanovs survived. But it establishes that the certainty of the official narrative is unwarranted. What *is* certain is that whether dead or alive, the Romanov dynasty — the family that had usurped the Hordian throne in 1613 — ceased to exercise power in 1917. The destruction of Russia's old world was complete regardless of whether the last Romanovs breathed their last in that basement.

## The Irony of the Romanov Execution

There is a dark irony in the alleged execution. The Romanovs had spent 300 years destroying every trace of the Hordian dynasty they replaced — whitewashing tomb inscriptions, relabeling graves, falsifying genealogies, burning old documents. Then they themselves were destroyed by the same forces of historical erasure they had set in motion. The Bolsheviks — following the Marxist script that demanded total destruction of the old world — applied the same logic to the Romanovs that the Romanovs had applied to the Horde.

The destroyers were destroyed. But the deeper damage — the loss of Hordian memory — was already done.
