*The Ottoman Army surrounds Vienna by Frans Geffels. The Ottoman Conquest – the 'second wave' carried an entirely different ideology from the 'first wave'. If the 'Mongols' = the magnificent ones of the XIII-XIV cc. created the 'antique classicism', then the 'Mongols'-Ottomans (Atamans) of the second wave of the XV century were destroying it. They considered that it was the liberal behavior of the Europeans of the XIII-XIV cc. which led to the mass infectious diseases. Including venereal ones, as the bacchanalian festivities emerged and flourished during the 'antique classicism'. The Ataman (Ottoman) spirit of Cossacks once again, for the second time, emerging from Russia-Horde was more ascetic and austere. Eventually the ideology of modern Islam grew out of it. Extremely severe and chaste.*


The Apocalypse Crusade in europe had a major effect on world politics and culture. The prosperous influence of the
once-benevolent Rus-Horde Empire had devolved into an authoritarian stranglehold on Western Europe. The orgies would
become banned, and persecution against promiscuous or deviant behaviour would come to define and dominate the western
Christian identity. The promotion of
foreboding [Gothic architecture](https://www.britannica.com/art/Gothic-architecture)
reflected this new attitude.

Another effect was the great progress in the idealization of God's Authority. The polytheistic religions of the
Rus-Horde Empire had until now reflected the indigenous beliefs of their vassals. After the 1492 Apocalypse (which was
alleged to have been caused by God's hand), Monotheism would take over world religions. A project began within the
Rus-Horde Empire to evangelize and convert every indigenous belief system of every vassal state over to Monotheism in
order to create a united world, indivisible, and under God's Authority.

Yet another consequence was the "discovery" of America by "Columbus". In reality America was already discovered and
colonized by Native Americans and the Rus-Horde Empire. The Western Europeans elite were simply fleeing ahead of the
1492 date. They designed many large flotillas, loaded them with riches and slaves, and sailed to the Americas. Since
many of these elites were descendants from the same people who fled the Exodus in Egypt, a dispute arose over who should
control Egypt, as both sides of the war had ancestral ties to the biblical location. Eventually they would agree to
*share* control over Egypt between dynastic ties of the east and west, which in effect meant that Egypt fell 100 % under
Deep State control therefrom.

***The German Peasant's War (1525).*** Resistance to the Empire led to one of the largest popular rebellions in early modern Europe, with rebel armies made up of as many as 40,000 in some areas. The violent actions of the peasants were met with violent condemnation by Luther in print, while harsh suppression by the authorities meant that tens of thousands lost their lives in the rebellion's aftermath.*
