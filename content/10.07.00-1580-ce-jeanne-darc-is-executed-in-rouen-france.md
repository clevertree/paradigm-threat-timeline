# Jeanne d'Arc is executed in Rouen, France

Scaligerian dating places Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), the "Maid of Orléans," at circa 1412–1431 CE. During the Hundred Years' War she led French forces against the English, freed Orléans from siege in 1429, was captured by the Burgundians and sold to the English, tried by the Inquisition for "insubordination and heterodoxy," and burnt at the stake in Rouen. According to Fomenko and Nosovskiy's reconstruction, however, **this date is displaced backwards by approximately 150 years** — placing her true historical position in the XVI century, around 1580 CE, within the broader epoch of the Ottoman conquest and Horde Inquisition.

## Joan of Arc = the Biblical Prophetess Deborah

*Even the supporters of the traditional version admit that the Maid of Orléans began to be called* **Joan of Arc** *only from the second half of the XVI century. But this implies that for a duration of more than a century the heroine was called something else. According to Fomenko's research, she was called* **Deborah** *— under which name she entered the Old Testament Book of Judges (chapters 4–5). Then, as interest in Joan grew, her other names fell into common use. In the XVII–XVIII centuries the original name Deborah was gradually removed from her story. The fact that Joan and Deborah were the same person was slowly forgotten. The 'biblical events' were pushed approximately 2,600 years further into the past — and the following generations of historians began sincerely to perceive Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah as two entirely different characters.*

The comparison between them reveals a vivid parallelism first noted by chroniclers of the XVII–XVIII centuries. Later historians reclassified this as mere "literary comparison" — but the original texts actually **directly identified** the two figures. The identification was systematically softened during the same editorial era that generally excised Slavic/Hordian traces from Western European chronicles.

## Empire-Wide Campaigns, Squeezed into France

In Fomenko's reconstruction, **Deborah = Joan of Arc lived in the epoch of the Ottoman conquest in the world of the XV–XVI centuries.** The original geography of her campaigns was correspondingly vast. The Bible and Josephus Flavius, describing these same events, reference:

- The **Assyrians** (Book of Judges 4:2) = the **Russians**, the armies of Russia-Horde ([6v1], ch.6)
- The **kings of Canaan** (Judges 4:2) = the **Khan rulers** of the Empire
- The town of **Kedesh** (Judges 4:6, 4:10) = the capital **Kadesh** = **Czar-Grad** (Constantinople)
- The waters of **Megiddi** (Judges 5:19) = the waters of **Macedonia**

When constructing the Scaligerian history, all of these large-scale Empire-wide campaigns were artificially squeezed into a single county in France. Distant geographical names were relocated here, and the entire story of Joan of Arc was converted into an allegedly "purely French" affair. This compression is a hallmark of the late XVII–XVIII century chronological falsification project.

## The Epoch of the Judges = the Epoch of the Inquisition

The Book of Judges of Israel describes the same era as the **Inquisition of the XV–XVI centuries**. Three storylines from the Judges correspond directly to major Inquisition trials:

1. **Deborah / Joan of Arc** (Judges 4–5): prophetess-warrior found guilty by the Inquisition tribunal and executed. One of the landmark cases of the Middle Ages.
2. **Abimelech / Simon de Montfort** (Judges 9): led the crusade against the Cathars, supported the Inquisition against "Cathar heresy" by fire and sword. Also described by Plutarch = Petrarch as the general Pyrrhus.
3. **Samson / Gilles de Rais** (Judges 13–16): French marshal and national hero. Faced the Inquisition court and was burnt at the stake in Nantes — one of the most infamous landmark cases "on witchcraft."

All three storylines are directly connected to the activities of the Inquisition on territory the Scaligerians labelled "France." The Inquisition itself was not the purely sinister institution of later Reformation propaganda. In Fomenko's reconstruction, it was a **Horde and Ottoman organization** whose aim was to eradicate the social consequences of the epidemics that had broken out in the provinces of the Empire, and to eliminate the distortion of ascetic Orthodox Christianity by the orgiastic cult elements that had flourished in the West — practices that led to social decline and the spread of disease.

## Gilles de Rais = Samson, and the Deeper Russian Original

![Samson and Delilah — Gilles de Rais and the biblical Samson are the same figure in Fomenko's reconstruction](/media/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/painting_samson_and_delilah_by_rubens.jpg)

*The famous French marshal Gilles de Rais, Joan of Arc's legendary comrade-in-arms, is described in the Bible under the name of* **Samson** *— the famous hero and warrior. This identification results from the stories of Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah being overlapping layers of the same events. Marshal Gilles de Rais faced the Inquisition court and was burnt at the stake in Nantes. All three main storylines of the Judges are directly connected with the activities of the Inquisition in the Scaligerian "France."*

The French version of Gilles de Rais, however, is only a secondary reflection. Fomenko shows that both Samson and Gilles de Rais are ultimately reflections of major XVI century events in Russia-Horde — specifically the struggle of **Zemshchina** against **Oprichnina** under Ivan IV (Grozny). The "Philistines" of the Samson story are the Oprichniki. The cunning Delilah who reveals Samson's secret to his enemies corresponds to the betrayal of Zemshchina leader Ivan Cheliadnin by Prince Vladimir Staritsky. The story of Samson's "fantastical strength" — which would be implausible for a single man — becomes comprehensible when Samson is understood as representing the entire social force of Zemshchina, backed by the Orthodox Church under Metropolitan Philip Kolychev.

The Inquisition therefore emerges not as a uniquely Western Catholic institution, but as an administrative arm of the **'Mongol' Empire** operating across its western provinces — recorded in France under French names, and in the Bible under Hebrew names, but describing the same underlying Imperial authority structure.

## Execution and Canonization

This forced the hand of the Imperial authorities, who saw no option but to eliminate Jeanne d'Arc before their own subjects. She was captured by the Burgundians, who for money handed her over to the Church. They declared Jeanne d'Arc a witch and subjected her to an ecclesiastical trial for charges of "insubordination and heterodoxy." She was burnt at the stake in Rouen.

Nearly 489 years later (per the Scaligerian date), in 1920, she was canonized by the Catholic Church — a belated recognition that the Empire's own administrative machinery had destroyed one of its own commanders.
