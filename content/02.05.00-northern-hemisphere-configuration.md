# Northern Hemisphere Configuration

![Northern view of Saturnian configuration - Mars, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Sun](/media/02.the-golden-age/saturnian_configuration_north.jpg)
*From anywhere on the northern hemisphere of the Earth, one could look northwards and see in order: Mars, Venus, then the gas giant Saturn. Behind Saturn was the gas giant Jupiter, which was not yet visible. Behind Jupiter, at a 26.7 degree angle, was our Sun. All together, they form an unmistakable Star and crescent in the sky worshiped throughout the Persian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, and throughout Islam today. This deity was known in Egypt as Osiris the *Triform God*, and as *The Trinity* in Babylonian and Abrahamic religion.*

From anywhere on the northern hemisphere of the Earth, one could look northwards and see in order:
Mars, Venus, then the gas giant Saturn. Behind Saturn was the gas giant Jupiter, which was not yet visible. Behind
Jupiter, at a 26.7-degree angle, was our Sun. All together, they formed an
unmistakable [Star and crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_and_crescent) in the sky worshiped throughout the
Persian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, and throughout Islam today. This deity was known in Egypt as Osiris
the "Triform God", and as "The Trinity" in Babylonian and Abrahamic religion. This crescent was slowly rotating causing
a separation between night and day:

> Genesis 1:4: And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

In [Norse mythology](https://skjalden.com/nine-realms-in-norse-mythology/), each heim ('house') in the configuration was
named so:
Muspelheim (Realm of Fire / Mercury), Alfheim (Bright realm of Elves / Venus), Midgard (Middle Land / Earth),
Jotunheim (Realm of Frost Giants / Mars), Asgard (Realm of the Aesir / Jupiter), Vanaheim (Realm of the Vanir / Saturn),
Svartalfheim (Dark realm of Dwarves / Uranus). Niflheim (Realm of Myst / Neptune), Helheim (Realm of the Dead /
Underworld / Pluto), The Norse also had a name for the Birkeland currents that bridged between worlds:
[The Bifröst](https://norse-mythology.org/cosmos/cosmology/bifrost/).

Sometimes locations were personified; Mars was Fenrir/Fenris the Wolf and appeared as a spherical planet, while Venus
was the Midgard Dragon / Serpent / [Doomsday Comet](https://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/talbott/talbott.html)
and appeared stretched out in many shapes and colors, none of which resembled a planet. It is during this time that Mars
made eight *descents* to Earth creating the appearance of Osiris,
the [Triform God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity).
