# Deep State Centralize World Religion at Jerusalem

![Deep State Centralizes World Religion](/media/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/deep-state-centralizes-world-religion.png)

After roughly 822 years in exile, it was time for the Deep State to resurface, rebuild their Monotheistic slave empire,
and claim sole authority to speak for the Creator God of the Universe. To this end, the Deep State built a new
headquarters in the narrowest part of the Bosphorus river in north-west Istanbul, a strategically advantageous location.
There they built a metropolis called Yoros in Turkish, Hierosolyma in Latin,
and [Kiev / Tsar-Grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsargrad) (City of the Czar) in Cyrillic text. In *redacted* Greek
Mythology, it was remembered as Troia or Troy. In its time this was the holiest city on Earth - because it was modeled
after the Heavenly Jerusalem described in the [holy texts](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html). This model
*(6 gates and 3 walls)* was first seen as a series of hexagons surrounding the brown-dwarf Saturn in the Golden Age
during the Collinear configuration of planets and is still
seen [today](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/saturn/hexagon-in-motion/). In old versions of
Jerusalem, each of the 3 *walls* had 6 gates resulting in the number **6-6-6** found in literature and often
associated with [Satan](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-connection-between-Satan-and-Saturn) i.e. Saturn.

## Why Rebuild a Celestial City on Earth?

The timing of this construction is the critical detail. By the 11th century, the common people of the world had moved
on. The [planetary saviours](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md)
were gone. The Sun was the new god, and with it came the gospel: **you don't need priests anymore.** Ordinary people
were free — and they knew it. (For the full argument, see [New Religion of Constancy](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.01-new-religion-of-constancy.md).)

No normal civilization, enjoying that freedom, would have chosen to rebuild a replica of the old celestial slave-city.
The 3 walls and 6 gates of Jerusalem encoded [Saturn's hexagonal signature](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.07.00-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md) —
the geometric fingerprint of Atlantis, the first holy city, which sat on the north pole of Mars during the Golden Age.
David Talbott's research confirms that the creation myth's central subject was *"the construction of a celestial
dwelling — a cosmic city, temple, or kingdom — revered across the millennia as the prototype of sacred space"*
([originsofmyth](https://saturniancosmology.org/)). Every earthly sacred city was built as a copy of this original.

The **only** group that would have needed to recreate that geometry on Earth was a priestly class that derived its
authority from it — a class whose entire claim to power rested on being the gatekeepers of the old Saturnian order.
The symbolic recreation of Jerusalem on Earth could only have been an attempt to **reassert control over a humanity
that had just freed itself**. The Sun had liberated people from the priest class. Jerusalem was the priest class's
answer: *we will rebuild the house of God on Earth, and you will need us to enter it.*

### Open Investigation: Mars/Atlantis as Architectural Template

It remains an **open question** whether the builders of Jerusalem at Istanbul were consciously replicating the
concentric-ring geometry of [Atlantis on Mars](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.07.00-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md)
— Plato's description of alternating rings of water and land "turned as with a lathe" (*Critias*, 113e–114a) — or
whether they were working from Saturn's hexagonal pattern alone, or from holy texts that combined both memories into a
single idealized blueprint. No source in the Saturnian Cosmology literature explicitly connects the 3-wall/6-gate
architecture of historical Jerusalem to Plato's Atlantis layout. The connection is inferential:

- **Saturn's hexagon** (still visible today) provides the 6-fold symmetry
- **Atlantis's concentric rings** (on Mars's north polar cap) provide the walled-enclosure template
- **Both were simultaneously visible** from Earth's north pole during the Golden Age collinear configuration
- **The Deep State priest class originated in Atlantis** and would have carried both memories

Until a primary source is found confirming the architectural derivation, this remains a plausible but unconfirmed
reconstruction. See [OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md](/docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md).

## The Fixed Calendar and the New Faith

The invention of the [fixed calendar](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.01.00-1053-ce-year-of-our-lord-deception-1053-year-shift-forward.md) provided the Deep State with a new system of faith based on the concept of constancy — that things change very slowly over time, or not at all. Jerusalem #1 in Istanbul was renamed [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople), and became the headquarters of the [New Religion of Constancy](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.01-new-religion-of-constancy.md). Since all information on the old Gods were kept secret in Jerusalem archives, the common people gradually forgot about them. The stories fell into mythology, replaced by new stories of the Sun traversing the seasons, which later became the [farmer's almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac).

## The Crucifixion: Proof of Intent

What confirms the nature of Jerusalem as a Deep State control centre — rather than a genuine place of worship — is what
happened there later. The [Crucifixion](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/) was not an act of piety. It was an
act of **political suppression**: the public execution of a popular figure who threatened the priestly monopoly, carried
out at the very site the Deep State had built to reassert that monopoly. A city built to honour Saturn's celestial order
was used to murder the man who told people they didn't need that order anymore.

This is what pinpoints Jerusalem in Istanbul as the reemergence of Atlantean authority over humanity. A genuine holy city
does not execute its prophets. A control centre does — when the prophet's message threatens the control.
