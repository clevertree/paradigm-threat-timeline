# New Religion of Constancy

> *The idea that things have always been the way they are — that the Sun has always shone as it does today, that the sky has always looked this way, that rulership over humanity extends back hundreds of thousands of years into an unbroken past — is the foundational lie of the age we live in. The very names Constantinople and Constantine carry this lie in their root: Latin **constans**, meaning "standing firm, unchanging, constant."*

## The Doctrine of Constancy

When the Deep State [rebuilt Jerusalem at Istanbul](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.00-deep-state-centralize-world-religion-at-jerusalem.md), they did not merely construct a city. They constructed a **worldview**. The invention of the [fixed calendar](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.01.00-1053-ce-year-of-our-lord-deception-1053-year-shift-forward.md) was part of a broader campaign to convince the population that the world was, and had always been, the way they saw it now.

This was the birth of what would later be formalised as **uniformitarianism**: the belief that the present is the key to the past, that the processes we observe today are the same processes that have always operated, at the same rates, for all of time. The Sun rises. The Sun sets. It has *always* done this. There were never planet-gods in the sky. There was never a [Golden Age](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.00.00-the-golden-age.md). There was never a [polar configuration](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.01.00-the-northern-hemisphere-configuration.md). The cosmos is, and has always been, *constant*.

## Constantine and Constantinople: The Names Are the Program

The name **Constantine** derives from Latin *Constantinus*, from *constans* (genitive *constantis*): "standing firm, steadfast, unchanging." This is from *con-* ("together, with") + *stāns* (present participle of *stāre*, "to stand"). It literally means **"the one who stands unchanged."**

**Constantinople** — Constantinus + Greek *polis* ("city") — therefore means **"City of the Unchanging One"** or more loosely, **"City of Constancy."**

This may be coincidence. Roman naming conventions followed family lineage and the name Constantinus existed before the emperor. But the argument here is not that the name was invented for this purpose — it is that the name was **chosen** for this purpose. In a tradition where [titles were transferred](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md) to match the current theological program (every saviour planet inheriting Saturn's title as "Son of God"), it would be remarkable if the single most important city in the new Sun religion received its name by accident rather than by design.

Constantine the Great was a worshipper of [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) — the Unconquered Sun — before his supposed conversion to Christianity. Sol Invictus was itself a theological assertion of constancy: the sun that **cannot be conquered**, that **cannot be replaced**, that **stands forever**. The transition from Sol Invictus to the Christian Sun-Christ was not a conversion but a rebranding. The theological payload remained identical: the current light in the sky is eternal, was never absent, and will never be superseded.

## Why Constancy Was Necessary

In the centuries following the departure of [Mars](/content/03.the-dark-ages/03.14.01-mars-aka-prometheus-replaces-venus-as-the-new-saviour.md) from geosynchronous orbit, living memory of the planet-gods was fading but had not yet disappeared. People still told stories of Saturn's golden warmth, Jupiter's cosmic mountaintop, Venus's blazing terror, Mars's gift of fire. The **problem** for the Deep State was that these stories undermined the claim that the current order was permanent and their authority eternal.

If the people remembered that gods had come and gone — that Saturn had been replaced by Jupiter, Jupiter by Venus, Venus by Mars, Mars by the Sun — then they would naturally expect that the Sun, too, would eventually be replaced. And worse: they would expect the current priesthood to be replaced along with it. The very concept of a [chain of saviours](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md) was an existential threat to permanent authority.

The solution was to **deny the chain entirely**. The Sun was not the latest in a succession. The Sun was *eternal*. It had always been there. The cosmos did not change. History did not record catastrophes, only the steady march of civilisation under the same unchanging sky. And the priesthood that administered this eternal order was itself eternal — it had always been there too, stretching back into an increasingly vast and fabricated past.

## The Deep State's Constancy Program

This program unfolded in stages:

1. **The Fixed Calendar** — By [anchoring time to the Sun's cycles](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.01.00-1053-ce-year-of-our-lord-deception-1053-year-shift-forward.md) and projecting the count backward, the Deep State created an artificial history of solar constancy. The Scaligerian timeline eventually pushed this back through thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands of years of alleged human history — all under the same Sun, all operating by the same rules.

2. **The Suppression of Catastrophism** — Every memory of planetary close encounters, plasma cataclysms, and sky-gods was redacted into myth, allegory, or madness. The Egyptian priests' account of [cyclical planetary catastrophes](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.07.00-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md) (Plato's *Critias* 111–112) was treated as fable even by the Greeks who recorded it.

3. **Uniformitarianism (formalised 19th century)** — When Charles Lyell published *Principles of Geology* (1830–33), he gave the doctrine of constancy its scientific legitimacy. Lyell deliberately [conflated two meanings of uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism): *actualistic* (physical laws don't change) with *substantive* (the Earth's current state is typical of its entire history). As Wal Thornhill observed: *"The geologists' uniformitarian creed has become anachronistic. As soon as they accepted that the Earth has suffered global catastrophes in the dim past, the attitude should have changed to THE PRESENT IS NOT THE KEY TO THE PAST."*

4. **Deep Time** — The extension of the timescale to millions, then billions of years served the same theological purpose as the original calendar extension: making human civilisation appear as a thin film on an eternal, unchanging surface. If the Sun has been burning for 4.6 billion years, nobody asks whether it arrived recently. The very question becomes absurd.

## The People's Sun vs. the Priest's Sun

There is an irony the constancy program could not fully suppress. The [Sun as saviour](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md) had originally carried a liberating message: **you don't need priests**. The Sun rose for everyone. It demanded no sacrifice, no intermediary, no temple class. The *gospel* — literally Old English *gōdspel*, "good word" — was that human beings were free.

The doctrine of constancy was the Deep State's answer to this freedom. If the Sun is eternal, then it requires an eternal institution to administer it. If the cosmos never changes, then the power structure that interprets the cosmos never needs to change either. Constantine's city — the City of Constancy — was the physical headquarters of this ideological program: a place where the eternal, unchanging, constant order was defined, enforced, and projected backward across a manufactured past.

## Open Status

**No source in the Saturnian Cosmology literature, Fomenko's New Chronology, or the Thunderbolts Project makes the explicit connection between the Latin root *constans* in Constantine/Constantinople and the theological doctrine of solar constancy.** The etymology is well attested (Latin *constans* = steadfast, unchanging), and the ideological program of constancy is well documented across catastrophist literature, but the claim that the naming was deliberate — that Constantinople means "City of Constancy" *as a theological program rather than merely as a personal name* — is original to this investigation.

This theory remains **open and unconfirmed**. It is recorded here as a working hypothesis. See [OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md](/docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md).
