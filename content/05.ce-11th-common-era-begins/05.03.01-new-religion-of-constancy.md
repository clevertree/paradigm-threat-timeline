# New Religion of Constancy

> *The idea that things have always been the way they are — that the Sun has always shone as it does today, that the sky has always looked this way — is the foundational lie of the age we live in. The very names Constantinople and Constantine carry this lie in their root: Latin **constans**, meaning "standing firm, unchanging, constant."*

## The Doctrine of Constancy

When the Deep State [rebuilt Jerusalem at Istanbul](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.00-deep-state-centralize-world-religion-at-jerusalem.md), they constructed a **worldview**. The [fixed calendar](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.01.00-1053-ce-year-of-our-lord-deception-1053-year-shift-forward.md) was part of a broader campaign: **uniformitarianism** — the belief that present processes have always operated at the same rates. The Sun rises. It sets. It *always* did this. There were never planet-gods. There was never a [Golden Age](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.00.00-4077-bce-the-golden-age.md). The cosmos is, and has always been, *constant*.

## Constantine and Constantinople: The Names Are the Program

**Constantine** derives from Latin *constans* (steadfast, unchanging), from *con-* + *stāns* ("to stand"): **"the one who stands unchanged."** **Constantinople** = "City of the Unchanging One."

The argument is not that the name was invented for this purpose, but **chosen** for it. In a tradition where [titles were transferred](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md) to match the current theological program, it would be remarkable if the most important city in the new Sun religion received its name by accident.

Constantine worshipped [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) — the Unconquered Sun — before his supposed conversion. Sol Invictus was itself an assertion of constancy: the sun that **cannot be conquered, cannot be replaced, stands forever**. The transition to the Christian Sun-Christ was rebranding, not conversion.

## Why Constancy Was Necessary

In the centuries after [Mars](/content/03.the-dark-ages/03.10.01-mars-aka-prometheus-replaces-venus-as-the-new-saviour.md) departed, living memory of planet-gods was fading but had not disappeared. If people remembered the [chain of saviours](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md) — Saturn replaced by Jupiter, Jupiter by Venus, Venus by Mars, Mars by the Sun — they would expect the Sun to also be replaced, and the current priesthood with it.

The solution: **deny the chain entirely**. The Sun was not the latest in a succession — it was *eternal*. The cosmos did not change. And the priesthood that administered this eternal order was itself eternal, stretching back into an increasingly vast and fabricated past.

## The Constancy Program

1. **The Fixed Calendar** — [Anchoring time to solar cycles](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.01.00-1053-ce-year-of-our-lord-deception-1053-year-shift-forward.md) and projecting backward created artificial history of constancy, eventually pushed through hundreds of thousands of years.

2. **Suppression of Catastrophism** — Every memory of planetary encounters and plasma cataclysms was redacted into myth, allegory, or madness.

3. **Uniformitarianism (19th century)** — Lyell's *Principles of Geology* (1830–33) gave constancy its scientific legitimacy, deliberately conflating *actualistic* uniformitarianism (physical laws don't change) with *substantive* (Earth's current state is typical of all history). As Thornhill observed: *"As soon as they accepted global catastrophes in the dim past, the attitude should have changed to THE PRESENT IS NOT THE KEY TO THE PAST."*

4. **Deep Time** — Extending the timescale to billions of years served the same purpose: making the question of a recently-arrived Sun absurd.

## The People's Sun vs. the Priest's Sun

The [Sun as saviour](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md) originally carried a liberating message: **the Sun rose for everyone, demanding no intermediary**. The doctrine of constancy was the answer: an eternal Sun requires an eternal institution to administer it. Constantinople — the City of Constancy — was headquarters of this program.

## Open Status

**No source in Saturnian Cosmology, Fomenko, or the Thunderbolts Project makes the explicit connection between Latin *constans* and the doctrine of solar constancy.** The etymology is attested and the ideological program documented, but the claim that the naming was deliberate is original to this investigation. This theory remains **open and unconfirmed**. See [OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md](/docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md).
