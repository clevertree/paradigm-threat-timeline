# The Sun replaces Mars as the new Saviour

The planetary saviour chain that began with Saturn closes here. With Mars gone from geosynchronous orbit, the sky fell quiet — and the only remaining brilliant body was the Sun.

## The Sun as Final Saviour

With each planetary catastrophe, surviving humans rebuilt theology around the body that had just dominated and receded. When Mars finally departed around 670 BCE, a theological vacuum opened. The Sun — present throughout, unchanging, predictable — stepped into the role. Across all cultures simultaneously, solar theology exploded:

| Tradition | Solar Deity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Egyptian | Ra / Aten | Solar disk as explicit state worship |
| Greco-Roman | Apollo, Helios, Sol Invictus | Unconquerable sun as supreme divine |
| Persian | Ahura Mazda | Lord of light |
| Mesopotamian | Shamash | Judge and lawgiver (title formerly Saturn's) |
| Christian | Christ | Light of the World, born at solstice, risen at equinox |
| Hindu | Surya, Savitr | Cosmic order restored through solar cycles |
| Aztec | Tonatiuh | The Fifth Sun, the current age |

## The Sun's Dual Nature

**The gift**: Consistent light, predictable seasons, a working calendar. After centuries of sky-chaos, regular solar cycles were genuinely miraculous — trustworthy in ways no prior saviour had been.

**The terror**: Ancient cultures preserved memories of solar megaflares. Norse *Ragnarok* culminates in Sol being swallowed. Revelation describes a sun scorching men with fire (16:8-9). Aztec theology held the Fifth Sun would also end. Zoroastrian Ahura Mazda stands in eternal opposition to Ahriman — light and destruction as two aspects of the same force.

## The Deep State Response: Son of Saturn

The pattern was always the same: **Saturn = the eternal Father; whatever currently saves humanity = the Son.** Every saviour in every era was plugged directly back to Saturn. No "Jupiter is the son of Saturn, Venus is the daughter of Jupiter" chain — the genealogy **reset** with each new saviour. This is why Greek god family trees never properly add up: they are not transmitting real lineage but **retrofitting** each dominant deity into the role of Saturn's heir.

> "I am the LORD your God... You shall have no other gods before me... for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God"
> -<cite>Deuteronomy 6:14-16</cite>

- **Christ** is the Son of God (Yahweh/Saturn), the Light of the World
- **Thor** is the son of Odin (Saturn), wielding lightning
- **Horus** is the son of Osiris (Saturn), bearing the solar disk
- **Ra** emerges from Atum — the sun as offspring of the first, invisible god

None describe the Sun as the son of *Jupiter* or *Mars*. Intermediate saviours are quietly dropped.

### The Human-Sized Saviour

The solar theology produced its most audacious variant: **a human being declared to be the Son of God.** This only worked because planetary memory had faded. By the Common Era, centuries had passed since Mars loomed or Venus blazed. The masses had no living memory of planets as saviours — the human-sized claim was the *only* version available once the sky had emptied.

> *"It was difficult to convince people that the Sun was the son of God when it was obviously not the distinctive, axially-placed golden ball they remembered from the Golden Age."*
> — Jno Cook, Saturnian Cosmology

The Sun rose and set, changed with seasons. The golden Saturn-ball had stood fixed at the pole, radiating eternal warmth. The Deep State theologians never stopped being asked: *if the father-god is so powerful, why is his son so much colder?*

## The Chain Closes

Each successive planet carried humanity through catastrophe, earned the title of saviour, then revealed itself as another source of destruction and was replaced. The irony the Deep State could not escape: every time they installed a new jealous god, its successor exposed the previous one as a fraud. Their own strategy — claiming each saviour as Saturn's legitimate heir — guaranteed eventual exposure.

Whether the Sun is the final link, or another body will rise to replace it, the Saturnian researchers leave deliberately open.
