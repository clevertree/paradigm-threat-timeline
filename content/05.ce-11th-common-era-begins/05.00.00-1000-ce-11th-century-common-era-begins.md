# 11th Century C.E. Common Era Begins

*The New Saviour — our Sun — rises as the dominant celestial body and human civilization enters a new era of stability.*

With an end to the *age of cataclysm*, the Earth bloomed with life. Predictable seasons prompted trade routes between cities. The red rings of the Absu began to fade revealing clear sky. The old Gods departed to become specks in the night sky, replaced by the *new Saviour*, our Sun. The *[rainbow](https://www.forthowardcc.com/blog/post/the-rainbow-covenant-)* became a common phenomenon signifying the promise of *no more creation*.

## A Global Explosion of Cities

According to Fomenko, the 11th century was **the dawn of civilization itself**:

> "The epoch prior to the XI century should be envisioned as 'primeval,' the dawn of civilization. During that time people still dwelt in caves and dug-outs."
> -<cite>[How It Was In Reality, Introduction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/introduction.html)</cite>

**Writing**, the **first calendar** (Paschal cycle), **astronomy**, and Ptolemy's *Almagest* all originated no earlier than the X–XI centuries. The entire apparatus of recorded civilization — cities, scripts, timekeeping, science — **bloomed simultaneously in a single century**.

In the Mediterranean, a kingdom emerged with its capital in the Nile Delta (Alexandria). In the XI century the metropolis moved to the Bosporus — **Yoros** (Jerusalem / Czar-Grad / Troy). In Mesoamerica, the Toltec empire rose at Tula and conquered **Chichen Itza** around 1000 AD. In China, **Yu-Huang** (Jade Emperor) had his cult begin in the 11th century and first temple built in 1115. This simultaneous founding across every continent points to a **global reset event**.

## The New Sun Religion

The old planetary Gods (Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Mars) had physically departed. An entirely new God dominated — our Sun — always present but now, with skies cleared, undeniable. Cook writes that *"the title of 'Sun' was transferred from Saturn to Jupiter everywhere"* during the upheavals — and ultimately landed on our Sun. See [The Sun Replaces Mars as the New Saviour](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md).

## Cities Built Like Circuit Boards?

An emerging investigation compares ancient city layouts to **printed circuit boards** — arguing cities were designed to channel electromagnetic energy from the Sun and telluric currents. Three pillars support this:

1. **The Electric Universe**: electromagnetic forces govern everything from particles to galaxies. *"There are no isolated islands in an electric universe."* Human settlements exist inside this circuit.

2. **Astronomically-aligned city planning**: Cook demonstrates Mesoamerican sites (Izapa, Chichen Itza) were precisely aligned to solar/planetary dates — engineering decisions orienting massive structures to celestial coordinates.

3. **"As Above, So Below"**: Ancient cultures reproduced cosmic plans in ceremonial architecture. If the cosmos operates electrically and cities mirror the cosmos, then **cities were electrical systems** receiving energy from above and below.

The **Romanesque cathedral boom** (11th century) may be the most visible evidence: hundreds of massive stone structures, oriented east, built with specific proportions, topped with copper and gold spires — appearing across Europe simultaneously. Energy-harvesting nodes in a continent-wide grid?

This inquiry remains open — more common in Tartarian/mudflood research than in academic-catastrophist sources. But the foundational physics, archaeological evidence, and philosophical framework are present in the archives.
