*With the end of the age of cataclysm, the New Saviour — our Sun — rises as the dominant celestial body and human civilization enters a new era of stability.*

With an end to the *age of cataclysm*, the Earth bloomed with life. Plants and animals multiplied in abundance.
Predictable seasons and weather patterns prompted trade routes to be established between cities. The red rings of the
Absu begin to fade revealing a clear sky. The old Gods have departed to become planetary specks in the night sky,
replaced by the *new Saviour*, our Sun.
The *[rainbow](https://www.forthowardcc.com/blog/post/the-rainbow-covenant-)*
would become a common phenomenon signifying the promise of *no more creation*:


## A Global Explosion of Cities

According to Fomenko's New Chronology, the 11th century was not merely a turning point — it was **the dawn of
civilization itself**. Everything before it is darkness:

> "The epoch prior to the XI century should be envisioned as 'primeval,' the dawn of civilization.
> During that time people still dwelt in caves and dug-outs. They didn't yet possess the know-how to build
> any significant structures, let alone any buildings of wood or stone."
> -<cite>[How It Was In Reality, Introduction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/introduction.html)</cite>

Fomenko argues that **writing**, the **first ecclesiastical calendar** (the Paschal cycle), **astronomy**, and
Ptolemy's star catalogue *Almagest* all originated no earlier than the X-XI centuries. If correct, this means
the entire apparatus of recorded civilization — cities, scripts, timekeeping, science — **bloomed simultaneously
in a single century** after the cataclysm ended.

The evidence spans every continent. In the Mediterranean, a kingdom emerged which Fomenko calls *the First Rome*,
with its capital in the Nile Delta (Alexandria). Farming *"developed rapidly in order to feed the large population.
Sciences and the first technologies originated here."*
([chronologia.org ch.1](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/01.html))
In the XI century the metropolis moved to the Bosporus, where the city of **Yoros** (Jerusalem / Czar-Grad / Troy)
was founded — a subject explored in detail in the child article on Jerusalem. In Mesoamerica, the Toltec empire
rose at Tula and conquered **Chichen Itza** around 1000 AD. In China, the supreme deity **Yu-Huang** (the Jade
Emperor) — ruler of Heaven and Earth — had his cult begin in the 11th century CE and his first temple built in 1115.

This simultaneous founding of advanced cities across every continent is difficult to explain as coincidence.
It points to a **global reset event** — the end of the cataclysm — followed by a rapid, coordinated emergence of
urban civilization under a new celestial order: the dominion of our Sun.

## The New Sun Religion

![The Sun-Saviour of the 11th Century](/media/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/11th_century_sun_savior.png)

The old planetary Gods (Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Mars) had **physically departed**. They shrank from
terrifying close neighbours to dim specks among the stars. An entirely new God now dominated the sky —
our Sun — a body that had always been present but which now, with the Absu dissipated and the skies cleared,
became the undeniable ruler of the heavens.

The Saturnian Cosmology research documents this transition. Jno Cook writes in *Chapter 19: Midnight Sun* that
*"the title of 'Sun' was transferred from Saturn to Jupiter everywhere"* during the planetary upheavals — and
ultimately landed on our current Sun after the cataclysm ended. The old name **Shamash** (literally "Sun")
was re-assigned from Saturn to the ecliptic solar body we see today. The mythological names **Ra**, **Helios**,
and **Sol** followed suit.

What arose was not merely a change in astronomical labels — it was a **worldwide revolution in religion**.
Solar deity worship took centre stage on every continent simultaneously: in Africa, Greece, Armenia, Arabia,
Aztec lands, the Baltic, China, India, Indonesia, and among the Celts, Incas, and Buddhists.
Meanwhile, the solarmythology.com research archive argues that Christianity itself is *"just another
allegorical personification of the sun"* — that the life of Jesus maps directly onto the solar year
(born at winter solstice, crucified at the vernal equinox, resurrected three days later as the sun
begins its ascent). If Fomenko is correct that Christ was born in 1152 CE, then Christianity is a
**12th-century sun religion** born one century into this new era — not an ancient faith retroactively
projected into antiquity. The child article *The Sun Replaces Mars as the New Saviour* explores this
transition in greater depth.

## Cities Built Like Circuit Boards?

An emerging line of investigation compares the layout of ancient and medieval cities to the traces on a
**printed circuit board** — arguing that cities were deliberately designed to channel electromagnetic
energy from the Sun and the Earth's telluric currents.

The indexed sources do not state this claim directly, but they provide the three pillars it rests on:

1. **The Electric Universe** ([thunderbolts.info](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/)):
   The Thunderbolts Project argues that electromagnetic forces — not gravity alone — govern galaxies, stars, planets,
   weather, and biological organisms. *"From the smallest particle to the largest galactic formation, a web of
   electrical circuitry connects and unifies all of nature… There are no isolated islands in an electric universe."*
   If the cosmos operates as an electrical circuit, then everything within it — including human settlements —
   exists inside that circuit.

2. **Astronomically-Aligned City Planning**:
   Jno Cook's research on site alignments demonstrates that Mesoamerican sites (Izapa, San Lorenzo, La Venta,
   Chichen Itza) were precisely aligned to specific solar and planetary dates — sunrise on August 12, equinox
   sunsets, and planetary conjunctions. These are not decorative choices. They are **engineering decisions** that
   orient massive stone structures to exact celestial coordinates.

3. **"As Above, So Below" — Cities as Miniature Cosmoses** ([mythsarehistory.com](https://www.mythsarehistory.com/as-below-so-above)):
   The mythsarehistory.com research documents that *"ancient cultures around the world seem to have been commonly
   motivated to incorporate astronomical or 'divine' plans in the arrangement and orientation of their ceremonial
   architecture, dramatizing the cosmogonic myths of the local culture by attempting to reproduce on earth a
   miniaturized version of the cosmos."* If the cosmos operates electrically (as the Electric Universe proposes),
   and cities were designed to mirror the cosmos, then **cities were designed as electrical systems** — structures
   intended to receive, channel, and distribute the energy flowing from both above (the Sun) and below (the Earth).

The **Romanesque cathedral-building boom** that swept Europe beginning in the 11th century may be the most visible
evidence of this phenomenon. Hundreds of massive stone structures — oriented east toward sunrise, built with
specific geometric proportions, and topped with copper and gold spires — appeared across Europe in a coordinated
wave. Were these merely houses of worship? Or were they **energy-harvesting nodes** in a continent-wide grid,
designed by builders who understood the electrical nature of reality?

This line of inquiry remains open. The circuit-board city thesis is more common in modern Tartarian and mudflood
research communities than in the academic-catastrophist sources indexed here. But the foundational physics
(Electric Universe), the archaeological evidence (site alignments), and the philosophical framework
(*As Above, So Below*) are all present in the research archives — waiting to be connected.
