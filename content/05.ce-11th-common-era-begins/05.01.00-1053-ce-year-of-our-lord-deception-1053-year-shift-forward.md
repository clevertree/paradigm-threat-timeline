# 'Year of our Lord' Deception - 1053 Year Shift forward

With the start of the Common Era, chronologists would write the phrase
[In the year of our Lord](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in%20the%20year%20of%20our%20Lord) before
each date. This meant a date which was occurring in C.E. times after the Lord (our Sun) appeared and after the start of
the *fixed* calendar. Writing the name of the Lord was forbidden and often only the letter <code>ι</code> was used
in place of the whole phrase. Later, in the 16th century the [Jesuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits) would
reinterpret the letter <code>ι</code> as a digit in the 1000th place. This redaction *shifted the calendar* 1053
years forward in time. They also interpreted *The Lord* as referring to *Jesus Christ*. This led to the erroneous
assumption that the historical Christ must have been born (or even died) around 0 AD. The original
meaning of "the Lord" in this context was the **Sun itself** — the astronomical body whose dominance
defined the start of the calendar era. The Jesuit conversion of this solar title into a personal name
for a divine individual was part of the broader redaction of solar religion into orthodox monotheism;

## "The Lord" Was the Sun

The phrase *Anno Domini* — literally "in the year of the Lord" — is universally taught today as a reference to
Jesus Christ. But in the framework of this timeline, the **Lord** was not a person at all. It was the **Sun**.

After the cataclysm ended and the Absu dissipated, the Sun became the dominant celestial body for the first time
in human memory. Every civilization on Earth simultaneously began worshipping it — not because of a shared
theological revelation, but because a terrifying new God had physically appeared in the sky and now governed all
life on the planet. As covered in
[The Sun Replaces Mars as the New Saviour](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.02.00-the-sun-replaces-mars-as-the-new-saviour.md),
solar deity worship erupted on every continent: Ra in Egypt, Helios in Greece, Shamash in Mesopotamia,
Amaterasu in Japan, Inti among the Incas, and dozens more. The old planetary Gods — Saturn, Mars, Venus —
had departed. The Sun was the only God left standing.

The *Common Era* calendar was therefore a **solar calendar** — and its epoch, "Year 1," marked the year the Sun
became Lord. "In the year of our Lord" was not a theological statement. It was an **astronomical one**: *this
many years have passed since the Sun took dominion*.

## The Two Redactions

The Jesuits performed two simultaneous acts of redaction on this dating system:

### 1. The Letter Became a Number

The abbreviation <code>ι</code> (iota) — standing for the full phrase *"in the year of our Lord"* — was
reinterpreted as the numeral **1** in the thousands place. A date written as <code>ι.053</code> (meaning
"in the year of the Lord, year 53") became **1053 AD** — adding a phantom millennium to the calendar. Every
date in European history was shifted forward by over a thousand years, creating the illusion of an ancient
Greco-Roman civilization stretching back millennia before the Common Era. The
[Phantom Time Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_conspiracy_theory) by Heribert Illig
identified part of this fabrication, though he proposed only ~297 phantom years rather than Fomenko's full 1053.

### 2. The Sun Became a Man

Simultaneously, "the Lord" was reassigned from the **Sun** to **Jesus Christ** — converting an astronomical
title into a personal theological one. This was not an innocent reinterpretation. It was the keystone of the
entire Jesuit programme to convert solar religion into Rome-mediated monotheism. Once "the Lord" meant Jesus
rather than the Sun, the calendar epoch no longer pointed to an observable celestial event — it pointed to a
birth in a manger, an event that could only be *believed*, never verified.

As documented in
[Jesuit Operations: Conversion and Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.03-jesuit-operations-conversion-and-catholicism.md),
the Jesuits exploited the global ubiquity of sun worship by declaring each local solar deity to be *the same
entity* as Jesus Christ. Older populations accepted this at face value — it was simply additional praise for
their already-worshipped Sun. But younger, literate populations were taught something different: that Jesus was
the invisible *Son* of an invisible God, severing the connection to the observable sky permanently. The result
was that the word "Lord" — which had once meant the blazing body overhead — was lifted off the sky and locked
inside scripture.

## The Downstream Effects

The 1053-year calendar shift cascaded through all of recorded history:

- **Ancient history was fabricated.** Events from the X-XIII centuries were duplicated backward in time, creating
  phantom empires (the "Second Roman Empire" superimposed on the Holy Roman Empire). As Fomenko documents, a
  chronological shift of 1053 years produces exact event-for-event duplicates between these periods.
- **The Blip was buried.** The cataclysmic period between the Golden Age and the Common Era — what this timeline
  calls [The Blip](/content/04.the-blip/04.00.00-670-bce-the-blip.md) — was stretched across invented millennia
  of "ancient" Greek, Persian, and Roman history, disguising a compressed era of planetary chaos as a gradual
  cultural evolution.
- **The Deep State centralized religion.** With the calendar anchored to Christ rather than the Sun, faith became
  mediated by Rome rather than verified by observation. The
  [Deep State centralized world religion at Jerusalem](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.00-deep-state-centralize-world-religion-at-jerusalem.md),
  replacing the old planetary mythology with a *fixed calendar* and a *farmer's almanac* — stripping the sky
  of its sacred meaning and reducing it to a tool for agriculture.
- **Year Zero became a theological anchor.** No local political or religious event has ever warranted a global
  retroactive reversal of a numbering system. As argued in
  [The Blip](/content/04.the-blip/04.00.00-670-bce-the-blip.md), the only adequate cause for resetting the
  calendar is a physical event ending one cosmic era and beginning another — the stabilization of Earth's orbit
  and the ascension of the Sun as Lord.
