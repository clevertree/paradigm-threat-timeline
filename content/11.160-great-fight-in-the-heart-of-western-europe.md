# Great fight in the heart of Western Europe

The [Thirty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War) (1618–1648) was the final military campaign to permanently eliminate any possibility of the Hordian Empire's restoration in Central Europe. Running continuously for three decades across the territories of modern Germany, Bohemia, France, Sweden, and the Low Countries, it was the most destructive war in European history up to that point — killing an estimated 8 million people and reducing the population of some German territories by 30–50%.

The official historical narrative presents it as a religious conflict between Catholic and Protestant powers, culminating in the Peace of Westphalia (1648) that established the principle of national sovereignty and religious tolerance. In the NC framework, this framing is precisely the cover story that the Romanov-aligned Western dynasties needed: Westphalia was not a peace treaty but a *carve-up agreement*, dividing the former Hordian provinces of Central Europe into permanently separate jurisdictions with incompatible legal systems, languages, and religions — the same project of cultural barrier construction that was being implemented simultaneously in language, chronology, and coinage.

## The Destruction of Cathar Castles and Hordian Fortifications

Per Fomenko ([Ch.7 §11](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)), the so-called "Cathar castles" of Southern France and the fortress complexes of Central Europe were not medieval relics of a 12th–13th century heresy — they were actual Hordian military fortifications. The Cathar Crusade was a 17th century event retrospectively moved to the 13th century. During the fighting of this period, these fortresses were systematically blown up with gunpowder — a 17th century technology, not a 13th century one.

The use of gunpowder against stone castles is the critical technical tell: fortifications of the allegedly 13th century "Cathar Crusade" were destroyed with explosive charges that did not exist in the 13th century. The explosions leave characteristic signatures in the ruins that archaeologists note but cannot explain within the conventional dating framework.

## Bohemia as the Battleground

The Bohemian phase (1618–1625) opened the war with the [Defenestration of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration_of_Prague) — the ejection of Habsburg imperial officials from a window — and the subsequent destruction of the Bohemian Protestant nobility at the [Battle of White Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain) (1620). In the NC context, Bohemia was one of the last territories where an older multi-ethnic, multi-religious administrative class — with connections to both the Imperial Slavic tradition and the Hordian financial networks — remained in power. The annihilation of this class at White Mountain and the subsequent forced re-Catholicization of Bohemia under Habsburg rule represents precisely the kind of deliberate cultural erasure the NC framework identifies as the Reformation's core project.

## The Almagest and the Thirty Years' War

One of the most consequential intellectual products of this period was the publication and promotion of the revised "ancient" Scaligerian chronology. Scaliger died in 1609 — just before the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War — and his chronological framework was being institutionalized across European universities in precisely the same decades that the Hordian resistance was being militarily destroyed. The timing is not coincidental in the NC framework: the false chronology and the military campaigns were two arms of the same project. Once the armies destroyed the old institutions, the falsified history removed the memory of what those institutions had been.

## The Peace of Westphalia (1648)

The Peace of Westphalia is often described as the founding document of the modern international order — the first treaty to enshrine the principle that each state has sovereignty within its own borders and others cannot interfere in its internal religious arrangements. In the NC framework, Westphalia formalized the permanent fragmentation of what had been a unified Empire. It made it institutionally *illegal* for any power to attempt to reunify Europe under a single authority — precisely the scenario that the heirs of the Romanovs and their Western partners most feared.

As these ties were cut, these families would become the Kings and Queens of their own states."* — [11.220 — Deep State breaks up the Hordian Empire](11.220-deep-state-breaks-up-the-hordian-empire.md)
