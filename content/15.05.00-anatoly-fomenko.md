# Anatoly Fomenko (b. 1945)

**Nationality:** Russian  
**Fields:** Mathematics, topology, statistics, historical chronology

## Primary Contribution

Mathematical and statistical proof that Scaligerian chronology is a fabrication. Fomenko is a full professor at Moscow State University, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and a leading topologist. Beginning in 1973, he turned statistical analysis toward published historical records — eventually analyzing over 2,200 sources — and discovered systematic misdating embedded throughout conventional history.

## This Timeline's Primary Framework

Fomenko's *New Chronology* (7 volumes) provides the backbone chronological framework for this timeline's medieval and post-medieval sections. His identification of three major chronological shifts (333, 1,053, and 1,800 years) and the placement of the historical Christ in 12th-century Constantinople structures this entire investigation.

## Key Findings

- **Three chronological shifts** of approximately 333, 1053, and 1800 years are embedded in Scaligerian chronology — the same brief chronicle apparently copied four times and presented as distinct eras
- **Lunar acceleration anomalies** (building on Robert Newton's 1972 work) show that ancient eclipse records are chronologically misplaced
- **All "ancient" civilization is medieval** — Greek, Roman, and Egyptian records describe events no earlier than approximately 900 CE
- **Andronicus-Christ** was born 25 December 1152 CE in the Crimea and crucified outside Constantinople in 1185 CE — not in 1st-century Palestine
- **The Mongol Empire and the Russian-Horde are the same entity** — "Genghis Khan" is a title, not a personal name

## Does Both

Fomenko both **challenges chronology** (his primary work) and **interprets ancient texts as encoding real historical events** (the Bible, Greek myth, and Roman chronicles are all interpretations of medieval events). This places him in both categories:

- → See [Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm](../00.01.05-authors-cataclysm-texts.md)
