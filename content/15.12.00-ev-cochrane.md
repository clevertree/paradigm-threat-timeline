## Primary Contribution

Systematic mythology analysis establishing that ancient myths about Mars and Venus describe a real catastrophic sequence of close-pass events witnessed from Earth. Cochrane is editor of the journal *AEON* and applied the comparative mythology methodology to show that mythological figures for Mars and Venus are not allegories or nature metaphors but observational records.

## Central Work

- **Venus as plasmoid** — documented the cross-cultural universal depiction of Venus as a multi-armed, hairy, star-like warrior goddess (*Inanna*, *Ishtar*, *Athena*, *Aphrodite*, *Quetzalcoatl*) consistent with a plasma-discharge column visible at close approach rather than the point of light Venus is today
- **Mars as the cosmic warrior** — argued that Mars myths (the warrior god, the dragon-slayer, the descending hero) recorded real near-Earth passes of Mars within the polar configuration
- **The "comet Venus" tradition** across Mesoamerican, Sumerian, Greek, and Hindu sources independently corroborates Velikovsky's comet-Venus claim with mythological evidence Velikovsky himself never assembled
- **Methodology** — argued that mythology cannot be explained by psychological projection or nature allegory alone; it is observational record. If the same "impossible" figure (the bearded multi-armed winged warrior planet) appears independently in 30 cultures, it was seen
