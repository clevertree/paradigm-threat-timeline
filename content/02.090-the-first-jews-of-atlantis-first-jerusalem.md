# The First Jews of Atlantis (First Jerusalem)

*Atlantis was the first holy city - First Jerusalem - built on the north poles of Mars and Earth to harness the energy of the Collinear Configuration and Golden Age.*

The term 'Jew' refers to anyone who worships the planet Saturn as a *Creator God* of the Earth (and its Universe) going
by the names YHWH, Adonai, El, Elohim, Jehovah, Shaddai, Tzevaot, Ehyeh, Ba'al, Elah, El Roi, Elyon, or simply HaShem i.e. "The
name". In history, the term 'Jew' refers to a closed society of people who claim to have *been chosen by* and represent
that same Creator God. The priest class of this closed society (a.k.a. Rabbis, Pharisees, Pharos) seek to execute
_God's_ _Authority_ over all aspects of life - finance, food, procreation, death and afterlife - even over humans
outside their society (i.e. the gentiles). They operate at the highest levels of human society (i.e. deep) and form the
protective outer layer of the so-called **Deep State** throughout history.

Until modern times, Jews managed to avoid intermarrying with non-Jews. By keeping
a [strict](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/safe-bris.page)
separation between their lineage and outsiders, they could pass down their inherited authority over the gentiles to
their ancestors and keep their power structure intact over the centuries. It is for this reason that Jews pop in and out
of the histories of the gentiles, and appear to have no origin or homeland themselves. The first appearance of this
priest class was before the fall of Atlantis — see
[Atlantis and the Tree of Knowledge](/content/02.080-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md) for how the Deep State
originated from the upper-class citizenry of Poseida.

In modern times, Abrahamic religions refer to this period in history as the Garden of Eden, and the city of Atlantis as
the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil). This story is also
reflected in the 1900 novel [The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz), and
the [1902 musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\(1902_musical\)) (both *ground-breaking* successes).
