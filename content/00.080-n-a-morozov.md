# N. A. Morozov

**Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov** (1854–1946) was a Russian revolutionary, scientist, and polymath whose
astronomical approach to biblical and historical texts made him a foundational precursor to the modern
[New Chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chronology_(Fomenko)) developed by Anatoly Fomenko.
He spent years imprisoned in the [Shlisselburg Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlisselburg_Fortress),
during which he produced much of his most significant scholarship. His work spans chemistry, physics,
astronomy, linguistics, and history.

## The Revelation in Storm and Thunder (1907)

*Otkrovenie v groze i bure* — published shortly after his release from Shlisselburg — proposes a radical,
secular, and astronomical interpretation of the Biblical Book of Revelation.

**Core thesis:** Morozov argued that the Book of Revelation is not a prophecy of the end times, but rather a
symbolic record of a specific astronomical event observed by the text's author — whom he argued was
[John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom).

**The date:** Using astronomical calculations, Morozov claimed to have identified the exact date represented
by the stellar imagery in Revelation as **September 30, 395 AD** (Julian calendar), based on observations of
the constellation over [Patmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patmos).

**The interpretation:** The vivid imagery of the apocalypse — the four horsemen, the dragon, the woman
clothed with the sun — are read as allegories for the sun, moon, planets, and constellations (Scorpio, Libra,
Leo) as they appeared during a solar eclipse on that date.

**Reception:** The work was considered highly controversial and was added to the index of prohibited books
by the Russian Orthodox clergy in 1908.

**Significance:** A pioneering work of astro-historical analysis that attempts to "demythologize" religious
texts by anchoring them in natural phenomena.

> Note: The Russian title is also translated as *"Revelation in Thunderstorm and Tempest"* or
> *"The Revelation to John: An Astronomic Historical Investigation"*.

## Prophets (Пророки, 1914)

A 1914 work applying Morozov's astronomical methods to analyze biblical texts, written as a continuation of
*The Revelation in Storm and Thunder*.

**Methodology:** Morozov argued that many historical events — particularly those in the Bible — were misdated
because they were based on false or misread astronomical data. He cross-checked textual descriptions against
reconstructed sky positions to identify the actual dates behind the narratives.

**Significance:** *Prophets* laid the groundwork for his comprehensive seven-volume series *Khristos*
(1924–1932), which detailed his revised, condensed timeline of history. While considered pseudohistory by
mainstream academics, it is foundational to the Russian New Chronology movement.

## Khristos (Христос, 1924–1932)

*Khristos: istoriya chelovechestva v estestvennonauchnom osveshchenii*
("Christ: History of Mankind in the Light of Natural Sciences") is Morozov's magnum opus — a seven-volume
work produced partly during his imprisonment — a comprehensive attempt to overhaul traditional historical
chronology using methods from astronomy, physics, and mathematics.

**Core thesis (New Chronology):** Morozov argued that the accepted chronology of ancient and medieval history
was significantly flawed. He proposed that much of early history was fabricated, with many ancient events
actually occurring much later in the Middle Ages.

**Astronomical methodology:** A core component is using the dates of astronomical events — eclipses,
planetary conjunctions — mentioned in ancient texts to determine the real time of the events. He analyzed
ancient religious texts, including the Book of Revelation, through a scientific, astronomical lens.

**Reinterpretation of religion:** Morozov argued that many biblical events and figures, including Jesus Christ,
were not historical in the traditional sense, but rather allegorical figures representing astronomical
phenomena or earlier events.

**Structure:** The seven-volume set covers various aspects of human history, with a focus on re-evaluating
the timeline of Mediterranean and European civilizations.

**Influence:** While considered pseudoscientific by mainstream academia, *Khristos* is significant as a
direct precursor to the modern New Chronology developed by [Anatoly Fomenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Fomenko).
