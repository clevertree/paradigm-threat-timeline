**Fields:** Independent research, Vedic cosmology, forbidden archaeology

## Primary Contribution

*Forbidden Archaeology* — a 900-page systematic documentation of suppressed evidence for anatomically modern humans appearing far earlier than the accepted Out-of-Africa timeline allows. Co-authored with Richard L. Thompson.

## Contributions

### The Archaeological Evidence

- **Suppressed anatomical findings** — documented hundreds of cases where modern human skeletal remains or artifacts were found in geological strata dated to millions of years ago — cases quietly discarded by the mainstream literature rather than addressed
- **The knowledge filter** — argued that scientific institutions systematically exclude evidence that contradicts the established human evolution timeline, applying non-scientific criteria to what counts as "acceptable data"

### Vedic Cosmological Framework

- **Vedic antiquity** — connected the archaeological evidence to Vedic cosmological accounts of cyclical human civilizations stretching back hundreds of millions of years
- **Devolution not evolution** — argued that humanity has devolved from a more spiritually and intellectually capable state, not evolved from a primitive one — the Vedic framework inverts the standard evolutionary narrative

### Implications for This Timeline

If even a fraction of the suppressed cases Cremo documents are valid, the human species is far older than the 200,000-year consensus. This has direct implications for every chronological framework in this timeline: earlier and more complex civilizations could have witnessed planetary events in the far deeper past that Saturnian Cosmology places before recorded history.

## Does Both

Cremo **challenges the timeline** (extreme human antiquity from archaeology) and **interprets ancient texts as historical reality** (Vedic texts as real cosmic history). He appears in both categories:

- → [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](../00.01.04-authors-challenging-chronology.md)
- → [Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm](../00.01.05-authors-cataclysm-texts.md)
