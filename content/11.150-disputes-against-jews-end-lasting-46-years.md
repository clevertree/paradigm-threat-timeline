# Disputes against Jews end lasting 46 years

The Tortosa Dispute of 1413–1414 was the largest formal debate between Judaism and Christianity in medieval history, lasting over 21 months and involving over seventy Jewish rabbis debating Geronimo de Santa Fe (Hieronymus de Santa Fe) before Pope Benedict XIII. The Dispute resulted in mass conversions of Spanish Jews and set the theological stage for the expulsion that followed decades later.

In the Marfull/NC framework, the Tortosa Dispute represents the final consolidation of Roman papal authority over the competing Avignon papacy. Pope Benedict XIII (the "Pope Luna" of the Aragonese obedience) was the last Avignon claimant standing. His resignation, forced by the outcome of the Council of Constance shortly after Tortosa, transferred all institutional religious authority back to Rome — completing the political consolidation that the Reformation needed to complete its theological project.

The 46-year span in the title refers to the period of recorded Jewish-Christian disputes from approximately the 1370s (beginning of the Great Schism, which fractured papal unity) through the Tortosa Dispute's resolution in 1414.
