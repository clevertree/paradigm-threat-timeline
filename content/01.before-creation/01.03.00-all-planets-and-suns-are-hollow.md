# All planets and suns are hollow

The reason for the [Absu](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.04.00-the-absu-layers-surrounded-the-planets.md) having multiple layers is described by [Electromagnetism](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnets.html). Any object with energy passing through it will [polarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizability), causing magnetic flux lines to appear in layers. At high amplitude, matter sticks to each layer, forming concentric circles that increasingly capacitate energy. Charging a space body with energy causes it to grow; as it grows, the gap between inner circles expands, causing the planet to become [hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfFJiUWuDk).

## The Lazeria Map Collection: Evidence for Polar Opening

From the 1500s–1700s, independent European cartographers recorded the same Arctic details: **four rivers flowing inward toward a central sea, draining into Earth's interior**. These were navigational maps, not allegorical works.

**Gerard Mercator (1569)** produced the most famous world map showing the North Pole as four large **Bargo Islands** separated by four rivers flowing northward to a central polar sea. Latin text: *"The rivers flow to the north and empty into the inner earth. The canyon beneath the pole is approximately 33 leagues wide."* His grandson's versions (1587–1636) retain identical detail — a transmitted 70-year tradition.

**Matthias Quad (1600)** confirmed: *"The large island has at its center a sea, which in its center lies the Great Dark Canyon."* He was banned by the Church that year.

Nearly every major navigational map 1570–1650 shows **Frisland** between Greenland and Iceland — a large island later declared "mythological." Soundings as late as **1944** confirmed a submerged landmass ~27 miles diameter, ~30 fathoms deep. The evidence suggests it sank.

## Arctic Explorer Accounts

Real explorer accounts consistently report conditions impossible on solid ice:

- **Joseph Moxon (1652):** Dutch sailor reached 2° beyond the North Pole — *"as warm as Amsterdam in summer"*
- **Elisha Kent Kane (1854):** At 82°N found *"vast open polar seas with heavy breakers,"* plus butterflies, bees, wolves, bears, geese
- **Dr. Fridtjof Nansen:** Recorded it becoming *warmer* approaching the pole; compass erratic; open water northwest; turned back due to compass failure, not ice
- **Multiple explorers:** Animals migrate *north*, not south, in winter — inexplicable if the pole is only frozen ocean

The wreckage of **USS Jeannette** (crushed 1881) drifted **3,500 miles** through the presumed polar ice cap — mechanically impossible without a through-channel.

## What the Maps Describe vs. Modern Orthodoxy

| Feature | Pre-1700 Maps / Explorers | Modern Orthodoxy |
|---|---|---|
| North Pole center | Central sea → canyon → inner earth | Solid polar ice |
| Four rivers | Flow inward | Not acknowledged |
| Open polar sea | Reported by Kane, Nansen, Moxon | Denied |
| Animal migration | Species migrate north in winter | Unexplained |
| Frisland | On 15+ major maps | Declared mythological |

The Lazeria Collection's conclusion: the evidence has never been addressed.

*[The Electric Universe Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Universe-Wallace-Thornhill/dp/B007SP1LK8) posits that celestial bodies can be best understood through electrical behavior — a force 10^36 times stronger than gravity.*
