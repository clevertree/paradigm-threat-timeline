# 3 Plasmoids in the Southern Hemisphere

![3 Plasmoids in the Southern Hemisphere](/media/01.before-creation/3-plasmoids-in-the-southern-hemisphere.png)

There was another bright source of light which was seen only from the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth before the Golden
Age remembered as [Hurakan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huracan)
in the Central American [Popol Vuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh)
and other Mesoamerican sources, and [Muspelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muspelheim) in
[Norse cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_cosmology).

## The Peratt Column: Plasma Physics Meets Petroglyph Evidence

**Anthony L. Peratt**, a plasma physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, published two landmark
papers in the *IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science* (2003 and 2007) demonstrating that approximately
40% of the millions of petroglyphs carved worldwide are direct representations of **plasma column
instabilities** — the observable forms taken by a massive discharge column of streaming electrons
that stretched away from the Earth's South Pole in prehistoric times.

### Structure of the Column

According to Peratt's reconstruction (corroborated and extended by Jno Cook in
[Chapter 10: The Peratt Column](https://saturniancosmology.org/peratt.php)):

- A plasma column in **arc mode** stretched from Earth's South Pole outward into space
- The column bent approximately **30 degrees** off Earth's rotational axis (allowing it to be glimpsed
  from as far north as ~70° N latitude — petroglyphs have been found in Norway at this latitude)
- **Three ball-shaped plasmoids** formed at distances of ~165,000, ~190,000, and ~435,000 miles
  from Earth
- The current consisted of **56 Birkeland current filaments** converging to 28 at the plasmoids,
  then twisting into 4 large filaments
- The plasma was in **synchrotron emission** — electrons spiraling at near-light speed about local
  magnetic field lines — producing visible light, UV, X-rays, and radio frequencies

The three ball plasmoids correspond to the **three stones** and the **turtle** of Maya cosmology,
and to the **three mounds** that cultures across the world encoded in burial mound construction,
standing stone alignments, and myth. Cook dates the column's active display period to
**10,900 BC – 8347 BC** (approximately 2,550 years) — ending at the Maya "13 Baktun / First
Creation" close date, confirmed by the Chilam Balam's statement that "God expressed himself with
the plasmoids and the column three times."

### Petroglyph Evidence

Peratt's team analysed data from over **4,000,000 petroglyphs** worldwide. Key findings:

- Petroglyphs recording the column were carved **high on cliff faces with an unobstructed southern
  view**, consistent with observers tracking the southern sky display
- Many were carved or re-carved **"two or three times"** — interpreted as humans returning to
  re-record the column after it temporarily vanished, or to coax its return
- Peratt identified **three epochs of concentrated worldwide petroglyph activity**, matching the
  three "showings" recorded in Mesoamerican sources
- The characteristic **squatting man / standing humanoid** form — seen in petroglyphs from
  Australia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia River (North America), Coso Range,
  Tassili n'Ajjer (Africa), and across Europe — reproduces the **Z-pinch / Bennett pinch
  instability** shape that forms naturally in high-current plasma columns
- In the southern hemisphere (below the equatorial rings of the Saturnian system), observers
  could see fine detail including **a face in the center of the nearest ball plasmoid**
- Northern hemisphere observers saw only the broader animal/humanoid outline, filtered through
  the intervening equatorial plasma

The Nazca Lines of Peru are also interpreted by Peratt as ground-level representations of the
north-south electron stream lines visible overhead from that latitude — only a few would have
been visible from Peru, matching the *Popol Vuh*'s description of the Opossum making **four streaks**.

### Mythological Parallels

The three ball plasmoids and the column itself are encoded in traditions across the world under
many names. From [mythsarehistory.com — The Peratt Column](https://www.mythsarehistory.com/peratt-column-the.html)
(see below for access note), cross-referenced with Cook:

| Form / Stage | Cultural Parallels |
|---|---|
| Blindingly bright ball plasmoids | Genesis 1:3 · Maori cosmology · Hawaiian cosmology · Muspelheim (Elder Edda) · *Popol Vuh* · Hopi cosmology · Çatal Höyük |
| Squatting / standing luminous humanoid | Adam Kadmon (Hebrew) · Jomon Dogu · Hindu Purusha · Sheela-na-gig · Huracan / God K (Mesoamerica) · Kokopelli · Coatlicue · Columbia River petroglyphs |
| Creator creature (ball plasmoid viewed end-on) | Maya Turtle · Phoenix · Egyptian Khepre of *Zep Tepi* · Çatal Höyük Bear · Nazca bird figures · Earth Diver (North American) |

The *Popol Vuh*'s **Hurakan** — the "Heart of Sky" — is the Peratt Column itself, and the name
is linguistically related to "hurricane" (a rotating column of energy). Norse cosmology's
**Muspelheim** (the primordial fire world in the south, from which sparks flew to create the
first light) likewise encodes the brilliance of the southern plasmoids, seen only before the
Age of the Gods began in the north.

### Why the Column Was in the South

Cook's account in [Chapter 10](https://saturniancosmology.org/peratt.php) explains why this
display was exclusively southern — a fact that initially *"confounded Saturnian catastrophists,
for it was never expected."* During this period, Earth was inside Saturn's lower plasmasphere,
positioned below Saturn's equatorial plane. Massive electron flows were streaming **northward
toward Saturn**, using Earth as part of the circuit. The source of the plasma was Saturn's electric field, not the Sun — the Sun was electrically invisible to Earth inside the coma.

The dedicated Peratt resource page at mythsarehistory.com —

Whether this isolation is the result of deliberate editorial removal, platform pressure on a
Los Alamos researcher's work, or simple site reorganization cannot be determined from the

the page and its PDFs are invisible to the modern web unless accessed by direct URL.
