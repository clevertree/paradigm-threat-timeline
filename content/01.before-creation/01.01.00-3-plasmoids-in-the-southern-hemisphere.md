# 3 Plasmoids in the Southern Hemisphere

Another bright light source was visible only from the Southern Hemisphere before the Golden Age — remembered as [Hurakan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huracan) in the [Popol Vuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh) and [Muspelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muspelheim) in Norse cosmology.

## The Peratt Column: Plasma Physics Meets Petroglyph Evidence

**Anthony L. Peratt** (Los Alamos National Laboratory) published landmark papers in *IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science* (2003, 2007) demonstrating that ~40% of millions of petroglyphs worldwide are direct representations of **plasma column instabilities** — a massive discharge column of streaming electrons stretching from Earth's South Pole into space.

### Structure of the Column

According to Peratt's reconstruction (extended by Cook in [Chapter 10: The Peratt Column](https://saturniancosmology.org/peratt.php)):

- A plasma column in **arc mode** stretched from Earth's South Pole outward into space
- Bent ~**30 degrees** off Earth's rotational axis (visible from as far north as ~70°N — petroglyphs found in Norway)
- **Three ball-shaped plasmoids** formed at ~165,000, ~190,000, and ~435,000 miles from Earth
- Current consisted of **56 Birkeland filaments** converging to 28 then twisting into 4
- Plasma was in **synchrotron emission** producing visible light, UV, X-rays, and radio frequencies

The three plasmoids correspond to the **three stones** and **turtle** of Maya cosmology, and the **three mounds** encoded in burial construction worldwide. Cook dates the display to **10,900–8347 BC** (~2,550 years), ending at the Maya "13 Baktun / First Creation" close date.

### Petroglyph Evidence

Peratt's team analysed over **4,000,000 petroglyphs**. Key findings:

- Carved **high on cliff faces with unobstructed southern views** — observers tracking the southern sky
- Many carved **"two or three times"** — humans returning to re-record after temporary disappearance
- **Three epochs** of concentrated worldwide activity matching three "showings" in Mesoamerican sources
- The **squatting man / standing humanoid** form (found from Australia to Peru to Africa to Europe) reproduces the **Z-pinch instability** shape in high-current plasma columns
- Southern hemisphere observers saw fine detail including a **face in the nearest plasmoid**; northern observers saw only broader outlines through intervening equatorial plasma
- The **Nazca Lines** are ground-level representations of the north-south electron stream visible overhead

### Mythological Parallels

| Form | Cultural Parallels |
|---|---|
| Bright ball plasmoids | Genesis 1:3 · Maori/Hawaiian cosmology · Muspelheim · *Popol Vuh* · Hopi · Çatal Höyük |
| Squatting luminous humanoid | Adam Kadmon · Jomon Dogu · Hindu Purusha · Huracan/God K · Kokopelli · Coatlicue |
| Creator creature (end-on view) | Maya Turtle · Phoenix · Egyptian Khepre · Nazca bird figures · Earth Diver |

The *Popol Vuh*'s **Hurakan** ("Heart of Sky") is the Peratt Column itself — linguistically related to "hurricane." Norse **Muspelheim** (primordial fire world in the south) encodes the same southern plasmoid brilliance.

### Why the Column Was in the South

Earth was inside Saturn's lower plasmasphere, below Saturn's equatorial plane. Massive electron flows streamed **northward toward Saturn**, using Earth as part of the circuit. The source was Saturn's electric field, not the Sun.
