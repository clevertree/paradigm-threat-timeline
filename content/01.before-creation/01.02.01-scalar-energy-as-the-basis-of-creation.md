# Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation

![Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation](/media/01.before-creation/scalar-energy-as-the-basis-of-creation.png)

[Scalar Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-scalar-energy-negative-ion-robert-e-chan) (ZPE) physics explains how original species were created in a high-energy environment *without* evolution. Large electromagnetic fields cause [quantum fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) that reorganizes matter. As plasmoids in the southern sky took new energetic forms, quantum fluctuations on Earth forced similar patterns to generate within a dense, mercury-like liquid metal abundant on the early surface. This conductive, fluid metallic substance allowed scalar-driven biogenesis: its high conductivity let quantum fluctuations reorganize it from within, shaping the first [Golems](https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem). Early Golems had no organs (they didn't need to eat, see, or move). Over the Golden Age, sustained scalar energy gradually forced internal differentiation, causing rudimentary organs to form as metal transmuted into biological tissue — not Darwinian evolution, but continued external scalar influence.

## The Electric Environment

The scalar field required for spontaneous biogenesis was produced by the Saturnian system's sustained plasma engagement with Earth. [Jno Cook's chronology](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php):

**9000–4900 BC (Hypsithermal):** Direct electromagnetic modulation by Saturn. Earth possessed equatorial rings — the **Absu** — suspended up to 8,500 miles above the equator. The Sumerian *Absu*, Egyptian *Duat*, and Maya *House of Nine Bushes* all record this structure (see [The Absu](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.04.00-the-absu-layers-surrounded-the-planets.md)). Combined with Saturn's plasma column, Earth was inside a double-layered electromagnetic furnace.

**4900–4077 BC:** Saturn visible as "the Egg" — glow mode sustained for 700 years (Finnish *Kalevala*: "Ilmatar drifts upon the waters for 700 years"). This was electromagnetic pre-conditioning.

**4077 BC (Nova Event):** Saturn transitioned from glow to **arc mode** — going nova. The glow mode coma collapsed instantly, generating peak scalar discontinuity: *"Saturn burst into arc mode, threw out enormous matter, developed a corona, and lit up like a sun."* The Egyptian *Ogdoad of Hermopolis* records this as a sound: *"The Great Honker gave a great screech which stirred the inert cosmos into action."*

## The Sustained Scalar Field: 4077–3147 BC

Following the nova, Earth entered 1,000 years of continuous arc-mode plasma — the **Era of the Gods**. Cook documents: *"Mankind was subjected for a thousand years to a varying magnetic field, a by-product of the rotating Birkeland current."* This oscillating field — scaled to planetary level — was not merely therapeutic but *generative*, reorganizing matter at the molecular level.

Mars descended the plasma column repeatedly during this period, each visit accompanied by massive arcing to Earth's surface. The Sumerian *King List's* eight "kings before the flood" may be arc mode discharge events, not human kings.

## The Golem Creation Window

| Period | Electromagnetic Condition | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **10,900–9000 BC** | "Younger Dryas" darkness; Earth in Saturn's lower coma | Biospheric reset |
| **9000–4077 BC** | Hypsithermal; glow mode; Absu ring system active | High-charge environment; scalar shell in place |
| **4077 BC** | Saturn nova — arc mode | **Peak scalar event — Golem creation** |
| **4077–3147 BC** | Continuous arc mode; oscillating Birkeland field | Sustained ZPE; Golems develop organs |
| **3147 BC** | Catastrophic flood; polar configuration collapses | End of scalar creation window |

The Golem entities emerged from a dense metallic mass, not rock. The scalar field organized this matter directly — its conductivity allowing quantum fluctuations to restructure atomic bonds. Over 1,000 years, sustained Birkeland oscillation forced internal differentiation: sensory, digestive, locomotive organs condensed as the scalar pressure demanded complexity.

> — Jno Cook, [Living in Paradise](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php)

The development of organs throughout the Golden Age was not biological evolution in the Darwinian sense — it was
electromagnetic transmutation of the original mercury-like metallic body, driven by the changing waveforms of
Saturn's plasma column as Mars repeatedly descended and retreated. Each pass altered the field configuration and
thus the scalar pressure on the conductive metallic mass, progressively converting liquid metal into living
biological tissue — bone, muscle, nerve, organ — from the inside out.
