# Russian Empire expands through conquest

By organizing the Crusades against Istanbul, the Deep State had a blueprint for expanding their conquest. Andronicus
Christ-the first emperor of the Rus Horde Empire-spoke against usury and slavery, but still after seizing control of
Istanbul, the Horde imposed both taxation and conscription on their new vassals. They would continue to do this in every
region they conquered. During the war, the army raised by the Horde was predominantly horse cavalry as horses were
native in the steps between the Volga and Don rivers. This allowed the army to move quickly over great distances. The
Russian czars-khans were able to equip the Horde with iron weapons, which in the Mediterranean were quite expensive and
unaffordable to many. To feed their army and new vassals, a new type of *slash and burn* farming was invented. Entire
forests were incinerated to create agricultural land allowing for mass harvesting without fertilization. Deforestation
continued for another 200 years until around 1503 when the Horde finally switched to the three-field system. They
realized that farm soil dries up after 30 years, unless the land is reclaimed by nature.

At the end of the 13th century, a [final unification](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html#uni8) of the
diverse peoples of Russia took place, partly peacefully, partly through military means, under the Grand Prince (or khan)
, Georgii Danilovich, aka Genghis Khan in [western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan) sources.
