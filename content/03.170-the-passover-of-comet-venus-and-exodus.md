# The "Passover" of Comet Venus and Exodus from the Pyramidal Empire

In the last 675 years, gas-giant Jupiter has been directly exposed to the Sun's field drawing energy into it and growing
larger. This eventually results in Jupiter flipping polarity and ejecting the consumed gas planet Venus. On April 19,
1492 B.C. Jupiter unexpectedly **expels Venus** as a massive Comet that **passes over** Earth's sky and heads towards
the Sun. The passage of Venus in proximity to the earth results in further _plagues_. Seeing the approach of
this "**angel of death**", the terrified population makes [ram sacrifices](https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-16.htm)
and splashes the blood on the sides of their houses. Jno
Cook [describes the event](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/syn.php):

> "Venus again made an electric contact with Earth, causing a crushing repulsive blow in the east Central Pacific.
> The Pacific islands were wiped clean of any trace of humans, except for the petroglyphs carved on every island
> thousands of years earlier.
> Coastal South America and Central America were inundated with water, leaving sea-water traces in lakes high up in the
> Andes,
> and possibly causing a sudden rise in the coastal range of the Andes by thousands of feet.
> The blow was followed by an electric arc traveling through the Pacific, the Indian Ocean,
> and part of India -- following a path of increasingly higher latitude into the Mediterranean
> as the Earth's axis angled back toward the Sun.
> The event is recalled in mythology as the attack of the monster Typhon who is struck down by Zeus.
> The major result of the contact was a 30 percent increase in the orbit of the Earth --
> the year went from 273 days to 360 days.'"
