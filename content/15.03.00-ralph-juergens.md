# Ralph Juergens

![Ralph Juergens](/media/15-author-profiles/ralph_juergens.png)

**Ralph E. Juergens** (6 May 1924 – 2 November 1979) was an American civil engineer and independent
researcher who is the originator of the **Electric Sun hypothesis** — the foundational claim that the Sun
is powered not by internal thermonuclear fusion but by an external cosmic electric discharge. His work
is the theoretical cornerstone from which the [Electric Universe](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/eu-guide/)
model of [Wal Thornhill](/content/15.02.00-wal-thornhill.md) and the Thunderbolts Project was built.

Juergens received a B.S. in civil engineering from
[Case Western Reserve University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University),
worked as an editor in the publications division of
[McGraw-Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill), served as an Associate Editor of
[*Pensée*](https://www.velikovsky.info/pens%C3%A9e/) magazine, and became a Senior Editor of
[*Kronos*](https://www.velikovsky.info/kronos/) journal. He retired early in 1960 and moved to
Hightstown, New Jersey — near Princeton — to pursue his independent research under the influence of
[Immanuel Velikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky).

He died in November 1979, two months after publishing his final paper, under circumstances recorded
only as "unknown causes." In 2007, Wikipedia
[deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens) his entry.
*Apparently the establishment wants Juergens' theories to die with him.*

## The Velikovsky Affair

Juergens became one of Velikovsky's closest scholarly collaborators. Velikovsky recommended him to
[Alfred de Grazia](https://www.velikovsky.info/alfred-de-grazia/) as science editor on a planned book
about the Velikovsky controversy. Together with de Grazia and
[Livio Stecchini](https://www.velikovsky.info/livio-catullo-stecchini/), Juergens contributed to a
special September 1963 issue of the
[*American Behavioral Scientist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Behavioral_Scientist),
titled *"The Politics of Science and Dr. Velikovsky"* — a landmark multi-disciplinary challenge to
the suppression of Velikovsky's work. This was expanded into the 1966 book
[*The Velikovsky Affair: Scientism against Science*](https://archive.org/details/velikovskyaffair00degr),
containing Juergens' essays *"Minds in Chaos"* and *"Aftermath to the Exposure."*

In **June 1968**, Juergens co-founded the
[Foundation for Studies of Modern Science (FOSMOS)](https://www.velikovsky.info/foundation-for-studies-of-modern-science/)
with de Grazia, Stecchini, and [Richard P. Kramer](https://www.velikovsky.info/richard-p-kramer/),
establishing an independent institutional base for catastrophist and alternative science research
outside of academia — explicitly not a "Velikovsky foundation" but a broader clearinghouse for
heterodox scholarship.

## The Electric Sun Hypothesis

In **August 1972**, Juergens first published his Electric Sun model in *Pensée* magazine:

> *"The modern astrophysical concept that ascribes the sun's energy to thermonuclear reactions deep
> in the solar interior is contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the sun. The
> interplanetary medium suggests not only that the sun and the planets are electrically charged,
> but that the sun itself is the focus of a cosmic electric discharge — the probable source of all
> its radiant energy."*
>
> — Ralph Juergens, *"Reconciling Celestial Mechanics and Velikovskian Catastrophism,"*
> [*Pensée* Vol. 2 No. 3 (Fall 1972)](https://www.kronos-press.com/juergens/)

This was a direct challenge to the fusion model at the core of 20th century astrophysics. Juergens
proposed that:

- The Sun and planets are **electrically charged objects** immersed in an electrified galactic medium.
- Charges arise from the **separation of positive ions and electrons on a galactic scale** — electric
  current flows from the galaxy into the solar system, powering the Sun.
- The Sun's **photosphere is an "anode glow"** — analogous to the luminous discharge zone of an
  electric discharge tube — not a surface through which internal heat radiates outward.
- The **corona** is the surrounding weakly luminous plasma, not a mysterious hot shell defying
  thermodynamic explanation.

Earl R. Milton, who compiled Juergens' final papers posthumously, summarized his framework:

> *"Juergens, however, went farther than all of his preceptors in electrifying both the cosmic
> bodies and their interactions. He perceived the astronomical bodies as inherently charged objects
> immersed in a universe which could be described as an electrified fabric."*
>
> — Earl R. Milton, compiler's note in *Kronos* Vol. VIII No. 1 (Fall 1982)

Of his precursors, Juergens acknowledged [Melvin Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_A._Cook)
who had noted in 1958 that accreted electric charge on the Sun could account for the solar constant
without thermonuclear processes, and
[Charles Bruce](https://www.velikovsky.info/charles-bruce-(physicist)/) whose electrical discharge
model of stellar atmospheres laid important groundwork. Juergens synthesized and extended both.

Juergens also noted that Velikovsky himself **never accepted the Electric Sun hypothesis** — Velikovsky
considered the thermonuclear model sound despite his own work on electromagnetic forces in the solar
system. This is a significant fracture point: Juergens' ideas derived from Velikovsky's framework but
went decisively beyond what Velikovsky endorsed.

## The Negative Sun Controversy

Juergens described the Sun's surface charge as **negatively charged** (a cathode in the cosmic
discharge). Later EU theorists — notably [Wal Thornhill](/content/15.02.00-wal-thornhill.md) and
Bernard Bligh — revised this to a **positively charged surface** (an anode). Neither Thornhill nor
Bligh have responded directly to or cited Juergens' specific *negative Sun* prediction in their
published work, despite building their entire theoretical framework on his Electric Sun foundation.
This internal discrepancy has not been publicly resolved within the EU community.

## Death and Redaction

![Ralph Juergens — died 1979](/media/00.overview/ralph_juergens_murdered.png)

Juergens died on **2 November 1979** of officially unknown causes — just two months after publishing
what would be his final two papers in *Kronos* Vol. IV No. 4 (Summer 1979):

- [*"Stellar Thermonuclear Energy: A False Trail?"*](https://www.kronos-press.com/juergens/k0404-stellar.htm)
- [*"The Photosphere: Is It the Top or the Bottom of the Phenomenon We Call the Sun?"*](https://www.kronos-press.com/juergens/k0404-photosphere.htm)

Both papers represented his most mature and comprehensive articulation of the Electric Sun model.
His death came at the moment his work was at its most dangerous to the thermonuclear consensus.

His SSDI record is available at [GenealogyBank](https://www.genealogybank.com/doc/ssdi/news/v1:112D897B0965B748).

### Wikipedia Deletion (2007)

In **2007** — nearly three decades after his death — Wikipedia
[deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens) the article
on Ralph Juergens, citing insufficient "notability" by Wikipedia's standards. The deletion erased
the primary publicly-accessible encyclopedic record of his existence and contribution. The AfD
(Articles for Deletion) discussion is still readable at the link above.

This occurred *after* Wal Thornhill had explicitly credited Juergens in peer-reviewed alternative
journals as the originator of the Electric Universe model, writing in *Aeon* V:5 (January 2000):

> *"The Electric Universe model follows the brilliant work of Ralph Juergens in which stars are
> manifestations of a cosmic glow discharge."*
>
> — Wal Thornhill, *"Stars in an Electric Universe,"* Aeon Vol. V No. 5 (Jan 2000)

Despite this citation — establishing clear intellectual lineage from Juergens to the entire EU
paradigm — his Wikipedia page was removed and has not been restored. No mainstream physics or
history-of-science publication has given him substantive coverage. His role in originating one of
the most significant heterodox cosmological frameworks of the 20th century has been systematically
erased from the public record.

## Alfvén's Reference to Juergens

In a letter from [Hannes Alfvén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n) — the Nobel
Prize-winning plasma physicist who founded magnetohydrodynamics — to researcher David Talbott
(discussing the Saturn-Earth electrical connection), Alfvén wrote:

> *"The physical model of what you suggest escapes me. If somebody, possibly Juergens, comes with
> a model, I would like to be told."*
>
> — Hannes Alfvén, letter to David Talbott (date uncertain; held in private correspondence)

This passing reference confirms that Alfvén was aware of Juergens and considered his potential
model-building relevant — a significant endorsement given Alfvén's own isolation from mainstream
astrophysics for his insistence on the importance of electric currents in space.

## Significance for This Timeline

Juergens' Electric Sun hypothesis is the physical mechanism underlying the Saturnian Cosmology
model central to this timeline. If the Sun is externally powered by ambient galactic current, then:

- Stars can transition between different discharge states (Brown Dwarf → active star) depending on
  the galactic current density of their local environment — directly supporting the
  [Before Creation](/content/01.00.00-5000-bce-before-creation.md) model of Saturn as a former
  Brown Dwarf that "lit up" on entering the inner solar system.
- The [Golden Age](02.00.00-4077-bce-the-golden-age.md) high-energy plasma environment is
  explicable as a period of elevated galactic current flux, not as a supernatural event.
- The [Short Cosmic Life Cycle](/content/00.02.03-cosmic-life-cycle.md) — the theory that Solar
  Systems undergo birth-death-rebirth cycles — is physically plausible if stellar energy is
  current-dependent rather than fuel-dependent, since a star's "death" is simply a withdrawal of
  ambient galactic current, not the exhaustion of a fixed fuel supply.
