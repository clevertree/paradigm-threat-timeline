# Other Challenges to Chronology

The claim that centuries of conventional history were fabricated did not originate with this project. Multiple independent researchers — using different methods, different data, and starting from different assumptions — have concluded that the Scaligerian timeline contains a substantial phantom gap. They disagree on the **size** of the gap, the **mechanism** of fabrication, and the **motive** behind it. This article compares them all.

For the detailed survey of all scholars who challenged Scaligerian chronology (De Arcilla through Fomenko), see [Building the New Chronology](/content/04.the-blip/04.01.00-building-the-new-chronology.md). This article focuses specifically on the **gap claims** — how many years are phantom, and why.

## Comparison Table

| Claimant | Phantom Years | Phantom Period | Method | Mechanism | Motive |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Heribert Illig** | ~297 | 614–911 CE | Calendar drift analysis; absence of archaeological evidence | Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII **inserted** phantom centuries to place their reigns at the symbolic year 1000 | Political legitimacy — ruling at the millennium |
| **Gunnar Heinsohn** | ~700 | 1st millennium BCE (ghost empires) + early medieval | Archaeological stratigraphy | Assyrian/Babylonian/Persian/Hellenistic/Roman layers are the **same stratum** counted multiple times | Chronological inflation to lengthen institutional pedigrees |
| **Immanuel Velikovsky** | ~500 (Egyptian only) | Egyptian–biblical mismatch | Comparative textual analysis (*Ages in Chaos*) | Egyptian dynastic dates are **shifted ~500 years** relative to the biblical timeline | Did not propose a deliberate motive; treated as scholarly error |
| **Anatoly Fomenko** | ~1,053 (primary shift) | 1st millennium CE entirely | Statistical dynasty analysis; eclipse verification; frequency analysis of proper names | The Scaligerian textbook was compiled from **four copies of one brief chronicle**, shifted by ~333, ~1,053, and ~1,800 years | Church chronologists (Scaliger, Petavius) constructed the system; later enforced institutionally |
| **This Project** | **1,723** | 670 BCE → 1053 CE | Fomenko's 1,053 + Jno Cook's orbital chronology (684 BCE final stabilization) | The Deep State **reversed the calendar at Year Zero** after the final cataclysm, then the Jesuits reinterpreted the abbreviation <code>ι</code> as the numeral 1000, adding a phantom millennium | Erase memory of the planetary gods and the recent cataclysm; establish permanent authority under the doctrine of [constancy](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.01-new-religion-of-constancy.md) |

## Where They Agree

All five frameworks share a structural conclusion: **the conventional timeline of the 1st millennium CE is not a genuine historical record**. The specific points of convergence:

1. **Something is missing.** Archaeological, stratigraphic, astronomical, and statistical evidence all point to phantom centuries that cannot be verified by independent physical methods.
2. **The gap is medieval.** The fabrication is concentrated in the period between late antiquity and the High Middle Ages — the exact period when the Church controlled the scriptoria.
3. **The mechanism is institutional.** Whether through deliberate political forgery (Illig), chronicle-copying errors (Fomenko), or calendar manipulation (this project), the phantom years were not accidental — they were produced by the institutions that controlled record-keeping.

## Where They Diverge

### Size of the Gap

The gap estimates range from ~297 years (Illig) to 1,723 years (this project). This is a factor-of-six disagreement. But the claims are not as incompatible as they appear:

- **Illig's 297 years** are a subset of Fomenko's 1,053. Illig identified the most visible seam — the absence of Carolingian archaeology — but did not apply statistical methods to the full chronicle record.
- **Heinsohn's ~700 years** target a different section of the timeline (the 1st millennium BCE "ghost empires") but arrive at the same structural conclusion: strata that should be distinct are actually identical.
- **Velikovsky's ~500 years** were limited to Egyptian chronology. He explicitly preserved the Scaligerian timeline for everything after the 1st century BCE, which Fomenko notes *"inhibited the development of new chronology in Western Europe considerably."*
- **Fomenko's 1,053 years** are derived mathematically: the three shifts (~333, ~1,053, ~1,800) are the eigenvalues of his dynasty-matching algorithm. The 1,053-year shift is the primary one.
- **This project's 1,723 years** extend Fomenko's work by incorporating the orbital chronology (Cook) that places the end of the cataclysm at ~670 BCE rather than at Year Zero. The additional 670 years are the BCE side of the Blip — the period between Mars's final departure and the conventional start of the Common Era.

### The Motive

- **Illig** proposes a local, one-time political fabrication by three specific rulers.
- **Heinsohn** does not identify a specific actor; the inflation is systemic.
- **Velikovsky** saw the mismatch as scholarly error, not conspiracy.
- **Fomenko** identifies the mechanism (Scaliger and Petavius constructed the system in the 16th–17th centuries) but treats the motive as primarily institutional momentum.
- **This project** identifies the motive as theological: the [Deep State](/content/00.overview/) erased the planetary gods and imposed the [doctrine of constancy](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.01-new-religion-of-constancy.md) — the belief that the Sun was always there, the sky never changed, and the current order is eternal. The calendar fabrication is not a side-effect of sloppy scholarship; it is the *primary weapon* of a deliberate program to erase catastrophic memory.

### What Counts as "Year Zero"

| Framework | Year Zero = | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Illig | ~614 CE (start of phantom) | Political calculation |
| Heinsohn | ~930 CE (stratigraphic discontinuity) | Physical catastrophe |
| Fomenko | ~1053 CE (end of phantom) | Statistical artefact |
| Cook / this project | ~684 BCE (final orbital stabilization) | End of planetary cataclysm; calendar reset |

This project argues that 684 BCE, Year Zero, and 1053 CE are **the same moment** — three different labels for the end of the age of cataclysm, separated only by the fabricated Blip. See [The Blip](/content/04.the-blip/04.00.00-670-bce-the-blip.md) for the full mathematical derivation.

## The Julian Calendar Proof

One of Illig's most compelling arguments — adopted by all subsequent challengers — concerns the **accumulated error of the Julian calendar**.

The Julian calendar gains ~1 day every 128 years against the solar year. By the time Pope Gregory XIII reformed it in 1582, the calendar had accumulated a **10-day error**. Working backward:

```
10 days × 128 years/day = 1,280 years of drift
```

But 1,582 years had allegedly elapsed since the Julian calendar's adoption (46 BCE). That should have produced:

```
1,582 ÷ 128 = ~12.4 days of drift
```

The **~2.4 missing days** correspond to **~307 phantom years** — remarkably close to Illig's 297. Fomenko's framework absorbs this into the larger 1,053-year shift: the calendar was not running for those years because those years did not happen.

## Why This Matters for the Timeline

The gap is not an academic curiosity. The size of the phantom period determines:

1. **How recently the cataclysm ended** — if the Blip is 1,723 years, the cataclysm ended less than 1,000 years ago. If Illig is right (297 years), it ended roughly 1,700 years ago. The difference is enormous.
2. **How much living memory survived** — a 1,000-year-old cataclysm means oral traditions of planet-gods were still circulating when the first churches were built. A 1,700-year-old one means they were long gone.
3. **How much redaction was needed** — the shorter the real elapsed time, the more aggressive the suppression had to be. A Deep State that needed to erase events from 1,000 years ago required far more institutional control than one erasing events from 2,700 years ago.

This project adopts the largest gap (1,723 years) because it is the only framework that accounts for both the statistical evidence (Fomenko) *and* the physical evidence (Cook's orbital chronology, the variable-year model, and the [day-count corrected age](/content/04.the-blip/04.00.00-670-bce-the-blip.md) of the inhabited Earth).
