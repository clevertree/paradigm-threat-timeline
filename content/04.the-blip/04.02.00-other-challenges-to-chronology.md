# Other Challenges to Chronology

Multiple independent researchers have concluded that the Scaligerian timeline contains a substantial phantom gap. They disagree on the size, mechanism, and motive — but converge on the structural conclusion. For the full scholarly survey (De Arcilla through Fomenko), see [Building the New Chronology](/content/04.the-blip/04.01.00-building-the-new-chronology.md). This article compares the **gap claims** specifically.

## Comparison Table

| Claimant | Phantom Years | Method | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Illig** | ~297 (614–911 CE) | Calendar drift; absent archaeology | Otto III, Sylvester II, Constantine VII inserted phantom centuries for millennial legitimacy |
| **Heinsohn** | ~700 (1st mill. BCE + early medieval) | Stratigraphy | "Ghost empires" are the same stratum counted multiple times |
| **Velikovsky** | ~500 (Egyptian only) | Comparative textual analysis | Egyptian dates shifted ~500yr relative to biblical timeline; scholarly error, not conspiracy |
| **Fomenko** | ~1,053 (1st mill. CE) | Statistical dynasty analysis; eclipse verification | Four copies of one brief chronicle shifted by ~333, ~1,053, ~1,800 years; Scaliger/Petavius constructed the system |
| **This Project** | **1,723** (670 BCE → 1053 CE) | Fomenko + Cook's orbital chronology | Pyramidal Empire reversed calendar at Year Zero; Jesuits reinterpreted <code>ι</code> as 1000, adding a phantom millennium |

## Where They Agree

1. **Something is missing** — archaeological, stratigraphic, astronomical, and statistical evidence all point to phantom centuries unverifiable by independent physical methods.
2. **The gap is medieval** — concentrated between late antiquity and the High Middle Ages, when the Church controlled the scriptoria.
3. **The mechanism is institutional** — fabrication produced by the institutions controlling record-keeping.

## Where They Diverge

**Size**: Gap estimates range from ~297 years (Illig) to 1,723 (this project) — a factor-of-six disagreement. But they nest: Illig's 297 is a subset of Fomenko's 1,053; Heinsohn targets 1st millennium BCE "ghost empires"; Velikovsky was limited to Egyptian chronology; this project extends Fomenko by adding ~670 years from Cook's orbital chronology (placing the cataclysm's end at ~670 BCE rather than Year Zero).

**Motive**: Illig proposes one-time political fabrication by three rulers. Heinsohn sees systemic inflation. Velikovsky saw scholarly error. Fomenko identifies institutional momentum. This project identifies theological motive: the Pyramidal Empire erased planetary gods and imposed the [doctrine of constancy](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.01-new-religion-of-constancy.md).

**Year Zero**:

| Framework | Year Zero = | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Illig | ~614 CE | Political calculation |
| Heinsohn | ~930 CE | Physical catastrophe |
| Fomenko | ~1053 CE | Statistical artefact |
| Cook / this project | ~684 BCE | End of planetary cataclysm; calendar reset |

This project argues 684 BCE, Year Zero, and 1053 CE are **the same moment** — separated only by the fabricated Blip. See [The Blip](/content/04.the-blip/04.00.00-670-bce-the-blip.md).

## The Julian Calendar Proof

The Julian calendar gains ~1 day every 128 years. By Gregory XIII's 1582 reform, 10 days had accumulated. But 1,582 years since adoption (46 BCE) should have produced ~12.4 days. The **~2.4 missing days** ≈ **~307 phantom years** — close to Illig's 297. Fomenko absorbs this into the larger 1,053-year shift: the calendar was not running because those years did not happen.

## Why This Matters

The gap size determines: (1) how recently the cataclysm ended — if 1,723 years, less than 1,000 years ago; (2) how much living memory survived — oral traditions of planet-gods still circulating when the first churches were built; (3) how much redaction was needed — the shorter the elapsed time, the more aggressive the suppression.

This project adopts the largest gap because it alone accounts for both Fomenko's statistical evidence *and* Cook's orbital chronology.
