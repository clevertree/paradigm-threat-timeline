# The Blip: 7th Century B.C.E. to 10th Century C.E. Never Occurred

> **Investigative status:** This chapter presents an **ongoing theory based on an unfinished equation**. Direct source support in the catastrophist literature is thin — no existing author has fully resolved the calendar-reset question stated below. The arguments here are internally consistent with Fomenko's shifts and Jno Cook's orbital chronology, but the core mechanism remains an open question. It is documented here because the absence of an answer is itself significant.

B.C.E. 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are actually the same year. After the cataclysms ended, the Deep State jealously
guarded records in *holy* church vaults, forbidding outsiders from viewing them. As the old *gods* and stories were
forgotten or fell into myth, it became easier for the Deep State to falsify the timeline. As a result of the success of
the Anno Domini Calendar conspiracy, humans today
(including [catastrophist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) authors
like [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://www.velikovsky.info/) and [Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/))
believe the events of *creation* ended over 2700 years ago.

In the model of catastrophism the date of the *end of ancient history* is the same date as the
last cataclysmic event — ~670 B.C.E. when the final orbit of 365.25 days was reached — and the same date as
the *beginning of modern history* — 1053 C.E. In other words, the age of cataclysm
**ended just under 1000 years ago**.

*Anatoly Fomenko's New Chronology complies with the most rigid scientific standards. It gives a coherent explanation of what we already know. Independent lines of inquiry all lead to the same conclusion. The predictions it makes are confirmed empirically.*

## The Unanswered Question: Why Did the Calendar Reset?

The central mystery of this theory is not whether the "Blip" years were fabricated — Fomenko's
statistical work strongly supports that — but **why any culture would design a calendar system that
counts backward into the past at all**.

The Anno Domini system, attributed to the monk **Dionysius Exiguus** (AD 532), introduced the
forward-counting CE era. The retroactive **BC / "Before Christ" count** was not established by
Dionysius; it was a later construction, gradually formalized through the work of **Bede** (*The
Ecclesiastical History of the English People*, c. AD 731) and not universally adopted in historical
writing until the late 17th century. The official explanation — that the calendar resets at the
birth (or death) of Christ — is a justification, not a cause. **No local political or religious
event has ever warranted the global retroactive reversal of an entire numbering system.**

The Dionysius system itself contains a known four-year error: his calculation of the year of
Christ's birth was off by four years, producing the calendar paradox that "Christ was born in 4
BC" — meaning the man the calendar was supposedly counting from was born *before* the calendar
began. This error was recognized but never corrected, because by the time it was identified, the
system was already entrenched. (Source: Patten & Windsor, *The Mars-Earth Wars*, 1996, via
[saturniancosmology.org/mech.php](../../../wget/saturniancosmology.org/mech.php.html).)

Additionally, historians acknowledge the **absence of a Year Zero** in the BC/AD system — the
calendar jumps directly from 1 BC to AD 1, a discontinuity that creates off-by-one errors in all
calculations across the era boundary. Jno Cook notes this explicitly in his chronology preface and
is forced to carry a standing correction factor for it in all ephemeris work.

**The question this theory is investigating:**

> *Why did the calendar restart at Year Zero and reverse the previous count backwards — i.e. BC?*

Proposed answer (unconfirmed): **The only mechanism that could justify a global calendar reset of
this kind is a physical event so decisive that it ended one world and began another.** Not the
death of a political or religious figure. Not a dynastic transition. A *cosmic* event — the final
stabilization of Earth's orbit at 365.25 days per year.

If the last cataclysmic plasma discharge (the Phaethon event, ~684 BC in Cook's chronology,
involving Mercury being struck by a Jovian plasmoid) was the moment the Solar System ceased
rearranging itself, then that event is the only reasonable candidate for Year Zero: the moment the
sky stopped moving, the year length became fixed, and a stable calendar became possible for the
first time in human history. Every previous calendar was provisional — written in sand, awaiting
the next orbital rearrangement. Only after 684 BC was a permanent era reckoning meaningful.

The backward BC count then follows naturally: someone — at some point — looked back from Year Zero
and tried to reconstruct the years that came before it. That backward projection was then frozen by
the chronological redaction documented in the Blip.

## The Young Earth Depth Problem

A second open question compounds the first:

**If the Earth is young — only thousands of years old — and if the creation dates were subject to
deep redaction, how far back does the Blip actually extend?**

The Scaligerian chronology places the beginning of the BC count at approximately 4,000–5,000 years
before Year Zero. The Saturnian model places the arrival of Saturn in Earth's orbit at ~4,077 BCE —
approximately the same depth. If both the Fomenko compression *and* the Young Earth thesis are
correct, then:

- The entire deep-time geological and paleontological record is a fabrication
- The "thousands of years BC" may themselves be a compressed or partially fictional extension of a
  backward count that only spans a few *real* centuries
- The true age of Earth's stable inhabited history may be shallower than even Fomenko implies

This is not resolved in this theory. It is recorded here as an **outstanding depth variable**: the
Blip may be a 1,053-year insertion in the middle, a fabricated deep past at the BC end, or both
simultaneously.

## What the Source Archives Confirm (and Do Not Confirm)

A survey of the downloaded catastrophist source archives ([saturniancosmology.org](../../../wget/saturniancosmology.org/),
[chronologia.org](../../../wget/chronologia.org/)) against this theory yields the following:

**Confirmed by sources:**
- The 4-year Dionysius Exiguus error is documented (Cook, Patten & Windsor)
- The absence of a Year Zero in the BC/AD system is documented (Cook)
- The final planetary stabilization event at ~684 BCE is confirmed as the last cataclysmic
  interaction (Cook — the Phaethon/Mercury event, also the date when the 365.25-day year is
  first attested in all ancient calendars simultaneously)
- Fomenko's three chronological shifts of ~333, ~1053, and ~1800 years are documented
- The 1053-year shift corresponds to the redaction identified in this project's Blip chapter

**Not confirmed — open questions:**
- No source directly asks why the calendar was designed with a backward BC count
- No source proposes the final orbital stabilization as the physical cause of the Year Zero reset
- No source accounts for the "depth of the Blip" under a Young Earth model
- The mechanism connecting the orbital event to the calendar construction remains unspecified

These gaps are documented in `docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md`.

## The Math: What Year Is It Really? How Old Is the Earth?

Taking the Blip hypothesis at face value and treating the following three premises as inputs:

1. **The Blip is real:** the years from 670 BCE to 1053 CE were fabricated and never occurred
2. **4077 BCE is Year One:** the arrival of proto-Saturn in Earth's polar orbit is the first year in
   which anything could have been observed and recorded — the beginning of the Golden Age and the
   start of the human inhabited timeline
3. **We are currently in 2026 CE** (conventional Scaligerian calendar)

The arithmetic follows directly.

---

### Step 1 — Size of the Fabricated Insertion (The Blip)

The fabricated period runs from **670 BCE** to **1053 CE**. These are the same real moment
expressed in two different chronological systems placed on either side of an invented gap.

```
Blip size = 670 years (BCE side) + 1053 years (CE side)
          = 1,723 fabricated years
```

---

### Step 2 — What Real Year CE Are We In?

Real time only resumed accumulating from **1053 CE** onward (the moment the fabrication ends and
real recorded history continues). From that point to the conventional present:

```
Real years elapsed since end of Blip = 2026 CE − 1053 CE
                                      = 973 years

Real current year = Year 973 of the post-cataclysm era
```

This is consistent with Fomenko's core finding: all genuine recorded history fits comfortably
within the last ~1000 years. We are not in year 2026. **We are in approximately Year 973.**

Equivalently: stripping the 1,723 fabricated years from the conventional date:

```
2026 − 1,723 = Year 303 (from the conventional Year Zero anchor)
```

Both expressions are internally consistent with different reference points but describe the same
real moment.

---

### Step 3 — Actual Age of Earth's Inhabited History

The first year in which events could have been witnessed and recorded on Earth is **4077 BCE** —
the arrival of proto-Saturn and the beginning of the Golden Age.

**Conventional elapsed years from 4077 BCE to 2026 CE:**

```
4077 + 2026 = 6,103 conventional years
```

**Subtract the fabricated Blip:**

```
6,103 − 1,723 = 4,380 actual years
```

**Verification via the other direction:**

- From Golden Age start (4077 BCE) to end of cataclysms (670 BCE) = 4077 − 670 = **3,407 real years** of the catastrophic era
- From end of cataclysms to present day = **973 real years** of the stable era
- Total: 3,407 + 973 = **4,380 actual years** ✓

### Results

| Question | Conventional (Scaligerian) | Actual (Blip-corrected) |
|---|---|---|
| Size of fabricated insertion | — | **1,723 years** |
| Current year | 2026 CE | **Year 973** (post-cataclysm) |
| Age of Earth's inhabited history | ~6,103 years | **~4,380 years** |
| End of the age of cataclysm | ~670 BCE | **~973 years ago** |
| Start of the Golden Age | 4077 BCE | **4,380 years ago** |

The Earth is approximately **4,380 years old** as an inhabited world — measured from the first year
in which a human observer could have looked up and seen the polar Saturn configuration overhead.
We are currently in approximately **Year 973** of the post-cataclysm stable era.
