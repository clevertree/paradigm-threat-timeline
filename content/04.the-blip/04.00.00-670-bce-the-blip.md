# The Blip: 7th Century B.C.E. to 10th Century C.E. Never Occurred

> **Investigative status:** This chapter presents an **ongoing theory based on an unfinished equation**. Direct source support is thin — no existing author has fully resolved the calendar-reset question. The arguments are internally consistent with Fomenko's shifts and Cook's orbital chronology, but the core mechanism remains open.

B.C.E. 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are actually the same year. After the cataclysms ended, the Pyramidal Empire guarded records in church vaults, forbidding outsiders from viewing them. As the old gods fell into myth, it became easier to falsify the timeline. As a result, humans today believe the events of creation ended over 2,700 years ago.

The date of the *end of ancient history* is the same as the last cataclysmic event (~670 BCE, final 365.25-day orbit) and the same as the *beginning of modern history* (1053 CE). **The age of cataclysm ended just under 1,000 years ago.**

## Why Did the Calendar Reset?

**Dionysius Exiguus** (AD 532) introduced the forward CE era. The retroactive **BC count** was constructed by **Bede** (~AD 731), not universally adopted until the 17th century. The Dionysius system contains a known 4-year error and skips Year Zero entirely.

> *Why did the calendar restart at Year Zero and reverse the previous count backward?*

**No local political or religious event has ever warranted a global retroactive reversal of a numbering system.** The only adequate cause is a physical event ending one cosmic era — the final stabilization of Earth's orbit at 365.25 days (~684 BCE, Cook's Phaethon event). Only after 684 BCE was a permanent era reckoning possible. The backward BC count was then projected from Year Zero. These gaps are logged in `docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md`.

## The Math: What Year Is It Really?

![The Blip — Math](/media/04.the-blip/the_blip_math.png)

Premises: (1) 670 BCE → 1053 CE was fabricated; (2) 4077 BCE is Year One; (3) 2026 CE is the present.

### Step 1 — Blip Size
670 (BCE) + 1053 (CE) = **1,723 fabricated years**

### Step 2 — Real Current Year
2026 − 1053 = **973 years** since the fabrication ends

### Step 3 — Nominal Age
(4077 + 2026) − 1723 = **4,380 nominal years**
Verified: 3,407 yrs catastrophic era + 973 yrs stable era = 4,380 ✓

### Step 4 — Day-Count Corrected Age

Ancient years were shorter. Each era multiplied by its actual day-length, then converted to modern years (365.25 days):

| Era | Years | Days/yr | Days |
|---|---|---|---|
| Golden Age (4077→3147 BCE) | 930 | 225 | 209,250 |
| Dark Ages (3147→2349 BCE) | 798 | 240 | 191,520 |
| Venus attacks (2349→2193 BCE) | 156 | 260 | 40,560 |
| Earth leaves Absu (2193→1492 BCE) | 701 | 273 | 191,373 |
| Earth leaves Jupiter (1492→684 BCE) | 808 | 365 | 295,120 |
| Final stabilization (684→670 BCE) | 14 | 365.25 | 5,113.5 |
| *(The Blip — fabricated)* | — | — | **0** |
| Post-cataclysm (1053→2026 CE) | 973 | 365.25 | 355,488.25 |

Total: **1,288,424.75 days ÷ 365.25 = 3,528 modern years**

### Results

| Measure | Scaligerian | Blip-corrected |
|---|---|---|
| Fabricated insertion | — | **1,723 years** |
| Current real year | 2026 CE | **Year 973** |
| Nominal age of inhabited Earth | ~6,103 yrs | **~4,380 years** |
| **Day-corrected age** | — | **~3,528 years** |

The Earth is approximately **3,528 modern years old** as an inhabited world. We are in **Year 973** of the post-cataclysm era.
