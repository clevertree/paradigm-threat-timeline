# The Blip: 7th Century B.C.E. to 10th Century C.E. Never Occurred

![The Blip — Time That Never Happened](/media/04.the-blip/684bce_the_blip.png)

> **Investigative status:** This chapter presents an **ongoing theory based on an unfinished equation**. Direct source support in the catastrophist literature is thin — no existing author has fully resolved the calendar-reset question stated below. The arguments here are internally consistent with Fomenko's shifts and Jno Cook's orbital chronology, but the core mechanism remains an open question. It is documented here because the absence of an answer is itself significant.

B.C.E. 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are actually the same year. After the cataclysms ended, the Deep State jealously
guarded records in *holy* church vaults, forbidding outsiders from viewing them. As the old *gods* and stories were
forgotten or fell into myth, it became easier for the Deep State to falsify the timeline. As a result of the success of
the Anno Domini Calendar conspiracy, humans today
(including [catastrophist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) authors
like [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://www.velikovsky.info/) and [Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/))
believe the events of *creation* ended over 2700 years ago.

In the model of catastrophism the date of the *end of ancient history* is the same date as the
last cataclysmic event — ~670 B.C.E. when the final orbit of 365.25 days was reached — and the same date as
the *beginning of modern history* — 1053 C.E. In other words, the age of cataclysm
**ended just under 1000 years ago**.

*BCE 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are all the same moment in time — the end of the age of cataclysm — obscured across three different chronological systems by deliberate redaction.*

## Why Did the Calendar Reset?

The central mystery is not whether the Blip years were fabricated — Fomenko's statistical work
strongly supports that — but **why the calendar was designed to count backward into the past at
all**.

**Dionysius Exiguus** (AD 532) introduced the forward CE era. The retroactive **BC count** was a
later construction by **Bede** (c. AD 731), not universally adopted until the 17th century. The
official explanation — the birth of Christ — is a justification, not a cause. The Dionysius system
contains a known 4-year error (Christ born "in 4 BC"), recognized but never corrected. The calendar
also skips Year Zero entirely, jumping from 1 BC directly to AD 1. (Source: Patten & Windsor,
*The Mars-Earth Wars*, 1996, via [saturniancosmology.org/mech.php](../../../wget/saturniancosmology.org/mech.php.html).)

> *Why did the calendar restart at Year Zero and reverse the previous count backwards?*

![Year of Our Lord Deception — Anno Domini calendar conspiracy](/media/04.the-blip/year_of_our_lord_deception.png)
*The Anno Domini ("Year of Our Lord") system, introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 532 and extended backward by Bede in c. AD 731, embedded a 4-year error and a missing Year Zero — artefacts of a retroactive construction, not a contemporaneous recording.*

**No local political or religious event has ever warranted a global retroactive reversal of a
numbering system.** The only adequate cause is a physical event ending one cosmic era and beginning
another — the final stabilization of Earth's orbit at 365.25 days (~684 BCE, Cook's Phaethon
event). Every prior calendar was provisional, awaiting the next orbital rearrangement. Only after
684 BCE was a permanent era reckoning possible. The backward BC count then follows: someone looked
back from Year Zero and reconstructed the years before it. That projection was frozen by the
redaction documented here.

**What the archives confirm:** the 4-year Dionysius error, the missing Year Zero, and the ~684 BCE
final stabilization event are all documented (Cook; Patten & Windsor). Fomenko's 1,053-year shift
is documented. **What no source addresses:** why the BC count runs backward, or why Year Zero was
chosen as a physical reset rather than a theological one. These gaps are logged in
`docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md`.

## The Math: What Year Is It Really? How Old Is the Earth?

![The Blip — Math](/media/04.the-blip/the_blip_math.png)

Premises:
1. **670 BCE → 1053 CE** was fabricated and never occurred
2. **4077 BCE** is Year One — the Golden Age arrival of proto-Saturn
3. **2026 CE** is the conventional present

---

### Step 1 — Blip Size

```
670 (BCE side) + 1053 (CE side) = 1,723 fabricated years
```

### Step 2 — Real Current Year

```
2026 − 1053 = 973 years since the fabrication ends
→ We are in Year 973 of the post-cataclysm era
```

### Step 3 — Nominal Age of Earth's Inhabited History

```
(4077 + 2026) − 1723 = 4,380 nominal years
```

Verified: 3,407 yrs of catastrophic era (4077→670 BCE) + 973 yrs stable era = **4,380** ✓

### Step 4 — Day-Count Corrected Age

Ancient years were shorter. Each era must be multiplied by its actual day-length, then the total
converted to modern year-lengths (365.25 days).

| Era | Period | Years | Days/yr | Days |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Golden Age | 4077 → 3147 BCE | 930 | 225 | 209,250 |
| Dark Ages begin | 3147 → 2349 BCE | 798 | 240 | 191,520 |
| Venus attacks | 2349 → 2193 BCE | 156 | 260 | 40,560 |
| Earth leaves Absu | 2193 → 1492 BCE | 701 | 273 | 191,373 |
| Earth leaves Jupiter | 1492 → 684 BCE | 808 | 365 | 295,120 |
| Final stabilization | 684 → 670 BCE | 14 | 365.25 | 5,113.5 |
| *(The Blip — fabricated)* | 670 BCE → 1053 CE | — | — | **0** |
| Post-cataclysm era | 1053 → 2026 CE | 973 | 365.25 | 355,488.25 |

*Sources: timeline articles 03.02.00, 03.08.01, 03.09.01, 03.12.01, 03.16.01; Jno Cook C-14 table.*

```
  209,250.00 + 191,520.00 + 40,560.00 + 191,373.00
+ 295,120.00 +   5,113.50 + 355,488.25
= 1,288,424.75 total days

÷ 365.25 = 3,528 modern CE years
```

### Results

| Measure | Scaligerian | Blip-corrected |
|---|---|---|
| Fabricated insertion | — | **1,723 years** |
| Current real year | 2026 CE | **Year 973** |
| Nominal age of inhabited Earth | ~6,103 yrs | **~4,380 years** |
| **Day-corrected age (modern year-lengths)** | — | **~3,528 years** |
| Time compressed by short ancient years | — | **~852 years** |

The Earth is approximately **3,528 modern years old** as an inhabited world. The ~852-year gap
between the nominal and corrected ages is the physical debt of all the short ancient years — a
225-day Golden Age year is only 61.6% of a modern year. We are in **Year 973** of the
post-cataclysm era.
