# Building the New Chronology

The case that Scaligerian chronology is a fabrication was not assembled by one person. It was
built over four centuries by independent scholars working in different countries, using different
methods, arriving at the same conclusion: the conventional ancient timeline is internally
inconsistent, astronomically incorrect, and structurally dependent on circular reasoning. Each
contributor added a distinct methodological layer. Fomenko's statistics were the capstone, not
the foundation.

## The Critics of Scaliger: A Chronological Survey

### De Arcilla (16th Century)

The earliest documented challenge to the Scaligerian system came from the Spanish scholar
**De Arcilla**, who wrote in the 16th century — within a generation of Joseph Scaliger's own
*Opus de Emendatione Temporum* (1583). De Arcilla identified internal contradictions in the
classical chronological sources that Scaliger had used, raising doubts about the accuracy of
ancient date calculations before the system had fully solidified into orthodoxy. The details of
his critique are incompletely preserved; he is primarily cited as evidence that opposition to
Scaligerian chronology began immediately, not retrospectively.

### Isaac Newton (1643–1727)

**Isaac Newton** is known to the public primarily as a physicist, but he spent more time on
chronology and theology than on any scientific subject. His *The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
Amended* (published posthumously in 1728) attempted to reconstruct ancient history by anchoring
mythological events to datable astronomical observations.

Newton's key method: using the **precession of the equinoxes** to date the Greek myth of the
Argonauts. The myth states that Chiron the centaur designed a star sphere for the Argonauts
showing the solstices and equinoxes at specific positions. Newton calculated backwards from the
precession rate and concluded the Argonaut expedition must date to approximately **936 BCE** — far
later than the conventional date of c. 1250 BCE. His revision shortened the Greek timeline by
300–400 years.

Newton was not a systematic chronological revisionist; his goal was to harmonize Greek mythology
with the Old Testament timeline rather than to question the Hebrew chronology. But his astronomical
method established a precedent: **mythological events can be dated by the sky they describe**, not
merely by literary tradition or dynastic king lists. This is the methodological ancestor of
Fomenko's eclipse work and of this project's planetary chronology.

### Jean Hardouin (1646–1729)

French Jesuit priest **Jean Hardouin** went considerably further than Newton. He argued that
**nearly all classical Greek and Roman literature was forged by Benedictine monks in the 13th and
14th centuries**, and that only a small residue of genuinely ancient texts survived. His specific
claims included:

- Most works attributed to Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Pliny, and Tacitus were medieval compositions
- The majority of ancient coins and inscriptions were fabricated during the medieval period
- The "ancient" Church councils before the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) either never occurred or
  were invented by forgers

Hardouin published his thesis in *Chronologie de Saint Jean Chrysostome* (1707) and related works.
He was condemned by his own Jesuit superiors, forced to recant, and his books were suppressed.
His methods were philological — he identified anachronisms, linguistic inconsistencies, and
cross-referencing errors in classical texts that he argued proved medieval authorship.

Hardouin's wholesale forgery thesis is more extreme than Fomenko's, but his core insight — that
the classical textual record cannot be trusted uncritically because it passed through medieval
hands — is shared by all subsequent revisionist chronologists.

### Petr Nikiforovich Krekshin (18th Century)

Russian court historian **Petr Nikiforovich Krekshin** (1684–1763), a contemporary of Peter the
Great and his successors, noted significant contradictions between Russian primary chronicles and
the Western European Scaligerian timeline into which Russian history was being forcibly integrated
during the Petrine modernization period. His objections were internal to the Russian documentary
record: dates in early Russian annals did not align cleanly with the official Western chronological
framework being imposed on them.

Krekshin's work is cited primarily within the Russian tradition of chronological criticism that
runs from his period through Morozov and ultimately to Fomenko. He represents the first
documentation of the problem that would later anchor Fomenko's work: **the systematic
inconsistency between Russian primary sources and the Scaligerian timeline**.

---

### Robert Baldauf (1867–1907)

German classicist **Robert Baldauf** published *History and Criticism* in four volumes (1902–1906),
arguing that most classical Latin and Greek literature dated not from antiquity but from the 13th
to 15th centuries CE. His method was philological: he showed that supposedly ancient texts
contained vocabulary, grammatical constructions, and cultural references that only became current
in the medieval period.

Baldauf's core argument: classical philology as practiced since the Renaissance depended on a
circular self-referencing system — ancient texts were dated by comparing them to other ancient
texts, none of which had externally verified dates. The entire structure was internally consistent
but externally unanchored. Baldauf was largely ignored during his lifetime; his work was only
rediscovered by chronological revisionists in the 20th century.

### Edwin Johnson (1842–1901)

British historian **Edwin Johnson** published *The Rise of Christendom* (1890) and *The Pauline
Epistles* (1894), arguing that the early history of Christianity as institutionally constructed
by the Church was largely fictional. His specific claims:

- The Church Fathers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries are literary constructions, not historical
  persons with verified biographies
- The New Testament canon was assembled later than the Church dates it, and partly under
  conditions of deliberate falsification
- The monastic scriptoria of the 10th–12th centuries were the primary site at which "ancient"
  Christian history was manufactured

Johnson worked from textual criticism and argued that the Church's historical narrative could not
be reconciled with genuine Greek and Roman sources. Like Hardouin and Baldauf, he targeted the
textual transmission chain as the point of forgery. His work anticipates Fomenko's finding that
ecclesiastical chronology is the structural spine of the entire Scaligerian system — and therefore
the point of greatest potential forgery.

### Nicolay Alexandrovich Morozov (1854–1946)

**N.A. Morozov** was the most comprehensive pre-Fomenko revisionist. A Russian revolutionary,
scientist, and mathematician who spent 25 years in tsarist prisons (1882–1905), he used his
imprisonment to conduct exhaustive research into ancient astronomical records, emerging with a
complete chronological reconstruction.

His seven-volume work *Christ: History of Human Culture from the Standpoint of Natural Science*
(published 1924–1932) argued:

- Every ancient solar and lunar eclipse described in surviving literature can be dated
  astronomically, and the dates produced by this method systematically contradict Scaligerian
  dating by 1,000–1,800 years
- Ancient "history" of the Mediterranean before the 3rd–4th centuries CE is largely a retroactive
  projection of medieval events onto an invented ancient past
- Byzantine history (supposedly 4th–15th centuries) substantially overlaps with earlier Roman and
  Greek "history" — they are the same events recorded twice, then separated by chronological
  falsification
- The astronomical dating of ancient zodiacs (Egyptian, Greek, Babylonian) consistently yields
  dates in the medieval period, not classical antiquity

Morozov's methods were mathematical (orbital mechanics, eclipse cycles) as well as philological.
He was suppressed by the Soviet academic establishment — after Stalin's historians had no use for
work that destabilized the chronological framework underpinning Marxist historiography. The effort
to bury Morozov required the participation of the mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov, who wrote a
critical paper that became the institutional justification for dismissing Morozov's work — despite
Kolmogorov privately acknowledging Morozov might be correct.

**Immanuel Velikovsky**, notably, accepted Scaligerian modern chronology while challenging ancient
chronology — he did not question the timeline from the 1st century BCE onward. This made
Velikovsky's work institutionally safer but left the core chronological falsification intact.

### Wilhelm Kammeyer (1889–1959)

German jurist **Wilhelm Kammeyer** approached the problem from documentary law rather than
astronomy or philology. His method: applying forensic document analysis to medieval German
charters, diplomas, and legal instruments. His findings, published across several works from
the 1920s through the 1950s, were:

- A systematic majority of medieval German imperial and ecclesiastical documents dated before the
  12th century are **forgeries**, identifiable by anachronistic legal formulae, seal-types that
  postdate the claimed document date, and ink and parchment characteristics inconsistent with
  claimed origins
- The forgeries were not random or opportunistic but systematic — a coordinated program to
  construct a documentary past for political and ecclesiastical institutions that lacked genuine
  ancient roots
- The scale of the forgery program indicated central coordination, consistent with the operations
  of the imperial Chancery and the major monastic scriptoria

Kammeyer was ignored by mainstream German historiography, partly because his conclusions were
inconveniently radical and partly because the forensic analysis of document authenticity was not
considered within the normal purview of academic historical methodology. He is the closest thing
in the pre-Fomenko record to a systematic physical evidence argument for the fabrication thesis.

### Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko (1945–present)

In 1972 American astrophysicist Robert Newton published an article where he described a strange leap in lunar
acceleration, and the so-called parameter D. In 1973, A. T. Fomenko, working as a faculty member of the Department of
Mathematics and Mechanics of the Moscow State University noticed the article and began researching several problems
related to moon physics. In 1980, he published his work on redacted eclipse dating — raising the question: if lunar
dating has been redacted in ancient history, what else has been redacted? In 1981, others joined
the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html) project.

Fomenko developed **three independent quantitative methods** for detecting chronological displacement in historical records:

1. **Frequency analysis of proper names** — the distribution of specific names in dynastic
   records follows statistical patterns. Duplicate distributions indicate duplicate chronicles
   (the same real events recorded twice, under different names and dates)
2. **Numerical dynasty encoding** — the sequence of reign lengths in king lists can be expressed
   as a numerical vector; identical vectors across supposedly independent dynasties indicate
   copying or duplication
3. **Astronomical eclipse verification** — claimed ancient eclipses, when back-calculated by
   orbital mechanics, do not match their claimed dates; the dates that *do* match consistently
   fall in the medieval period rather than classical antiquity

> "It became obvious that the complexity of this issue demanded the development of new independent
> methods of dating. Hence the main focus in 1973–1980 was on developing methods of analyzing
> historical texts that were based on mathematical statistics, a number of which was proposed and
> formulated by A. T. Fomenko in 1975–1979. They allowed for the elucidation of the global picture
> of chronological misdatings in Scaliger's version and elimination. More specifically,
> A. T. Fomenko had discovered three important chronological shifts, of roughly 333 years, 1053,
> and 1800 years respectively. These shifts are only inherent to the erroneous chronology of
> Scaliger-Petavius, and have nothing to do with the correct one. It turned out that 'the
> Scaligerian textbook' was compiled from four copies of one and the same brief chronicle."

The 1,053-year shift is the one directly relevant to the Blip.

## Convergence

Eight independent scholars, four centuries, four countries, five methods (astronomical dating,
textual criticism, document forensics, statistical analysis, linguistic anachronism analysis)
— all pointing to the same structural conclusion: **the Scaligerian timeline covering the first
millennium CE is not a real historical record. It is a constructed chronology, assembled from
displaced copies of genuinely medieval sources, and enforced institutionally because it is the
temporal foundation of every existing political and religious authority that traces its legitimacy
to ancient precedent.**

The Blip — the fabricated gap from 670 BCE to 1053 CE — is what the convergence of all these
methods implies.
