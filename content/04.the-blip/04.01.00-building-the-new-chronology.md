# Building the New Chronology: Fomenko’s Mathematical Method

For the full history of Scaligerian chronology criticism — from De Arcilla and Newton through Morozov — see
[How the New Chronology Was Built](/content/04.the-blip/04.02.00-how-the-new-chronology-was-built.md).
This article covers Fomenko’s specific mathematical approach: the statistical method that transformed
chronological criticism from literary argument into quantitative science.

*Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko is a Soviet and Russian historical theorist, mathematician, professor at Moscow State University, well-known as a topologist, and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.*

In 1972 American astrophysicist Robert Newton published an article where he described a strange leap in lunar
acceleration, and the so-called parameter D. In 1973, A. T. Fomenko, working as a faculty member of the Department of
Mathematics and Mechanics of the Moscow State University noticed the article and began researching several problems
related to moon physics. In 1980, he published his work on redacted eclipse dating - leading to the question - If Lunar
Dating has been redacted in ancient history, what else has been redacted from history? In 1981, others join
the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html) project:

> It became obvious that the complexity of this issue demanded the development of new independent methods of dating.
> Hence the main focus in 1973-1980 was on developing methods of analyzing historical texts that were based on
> mathematical statistics, a number of which was proposed and formulated by A. T. Fomenko in 1975-1979. They allowed for
> the elucidation of the global picture of chronological misdatings in Scaliger's version and elimination. More
> specifically, A. T. Fomenko had discovered three important chronological shifts, of roughly 333 years, 1053, and 1800
> years respectively. These shifts are only inherent to the erroneous chronology of Scaliger-Petavius, and have nothing
> to do with the correct one. It turned out that "the Scaligerian textbook" was compiled from four copies of one and the
> same brief chronicle. [Source](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html)

As scrupulous as the work was, it was still not possible for the historical science community at large to acknowledge
the possibility that Scaligarian chronology could be in any way flawed, and Fomenko's work fell into obscurity. In
this we once again see the enduring influence of the **Deep State**:

> Today we are being convinced that everything had happened "automatically" and that N. A. Morozov's research was of
> little enough interest to have been forgotten by everyone in a short time. We are now beginning to understand that the
> forces opposing N. A. Morozov were all the more formidable to have needed the participation of A. N. Kolmogorov. It is
> also noteworthy that A. N. Kolmogorov considered it possible for N. A. Morozov to have been correct.
