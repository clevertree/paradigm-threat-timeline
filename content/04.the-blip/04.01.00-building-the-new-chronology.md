# Building the New Chronology

The case that Scaligerian chronology is a fabrication was not assembled by one person. It was
built over four centuries by independent scholars working in different countries, using different
methods, arriving at the same conclusion: the conventional ancient timeline is internally
inconsistent, astronomically incorrect, and structurally dependent on circular reasoning. Each
contributor added a distinct methodological layer. Fomenko's statistics were the capstone, not
the foundation.

## The Critics of Scaliger: A Chronological Survey

### De Arcilla (16th Century)

Spanish scholar **De Arcilla** wrote within a generation of Scaliger's *Opus de Emendatione Temporum* (1583), identifying internal contradictions in the classical sources before the system had solidified into orthodoxy. His critique is incompletely preserved but establishes that opposition to Scaligerian chronology began immediately.

---

### Isaac Newton (1643–1727)

**Isaac Newton** spent more time on chronology than on physics. His *Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended* (1728, posthumous) used the **precession of the equinoxes** to date the Argonaut myth, concluding the expedition dated to **936 BCE** — 300–400 years later than the conventional c. 1250 BCE. His goal was to harmonize Greek mythology with the Old Testament rather than question all chronology, but he established the key precedent: **mythological events can be dated by the sky they describe**. This is the methodological ancestor of Fomenko's eclipse work.

### Jean Hardouin (1646–1729)

French Jesuit **Jean Hardouin** argued that **nearly all classical Greek and Roman literature was forged by Benedictine monks in the 13th–14th centuries** — including works attributed to Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Pliny, and Tacitus. He identified anachronisms, linguistic inconsistencies, and cross-referencing errors proving medieval authorship (*Chronologie de Saint Jean Chrysostome*, 1707). Condemned by his Jesuit superiors and forced to recant, his core insight survives: the classical textual record cannot be trusted uncritically because it passed through medieval hands.

### Petr Nikiforovich Krekshin (18th Century)

Russian court historian **Krekshin** (1684–1763) documented contradictions between Russian primary chronicles and the Scaligerian timeline being forcibly imposed during Petrine modernization. He represents the first documentation of **the systematic inconsistency between Russian primary sources and the Scaligerian timeline** — the problem that would later anchor Fomenko's work.

---

### Robert Baldauf (1867–1907)

German classicist **Baldauf** (*History and Criticism*, 4 vols., 1902–1906) showed that supposedly ancient texts contained vocabulary and cultural references that only became current in the 13th–15th centuries CE. His core argument: classical philology depended on **circular self-referencing** — ancient texts dated by comparison to other ancient texts, none with externally verified dates. Ignored in his lifetime, rediscovered by 20th-century revisionists.

---

### Edwin Johnson (1842–1901)

British historian **Edwin Johnson** (*The Rise of Christendom*, 1890; *The Pauline Epistles*, 1894) argued that early Christian history was largely fictional — the Church Fathers are literary constructions, the New Testament canon was assembled later than claimed, and the monastic scriptoria of the 10th–12th centuries manufactured "ancient" Christian history. His work anticipates Fomenko's finding that ecclesiastical chronology is the structural spine of the Scaligerian system.

---

### Nicolay Alexandrovich Morozov (1854–1946)

**N.A. Morozov** — Russian revolutionary, scientist, mathematician — spent 25 years in tsarist prisons (1882–1905) and used his imprisonment for exhaustive astronomical research. His seven-volume *Christ: History of Human Culture from the Standpoint of Natural Science* (1924–1932) argued that every ancient eclipse contradicts Scaligerian dating by 1,000–1,800 years; Mediterranean "history" before the 3rd–4th centuries CE is retroactive projection of medieval events; and Byzantine history substantially overlaps with Roman and Greek "history" — the same events recorded twice. Ancient zodiacs consistently yield medieval dates.

Morozov was suppressed by the Soviet establishment. The effort required mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov to write a critical paper as institutional justification — despite Kolmogorov privately acknowledging Morozov might be correct.

> "We are now beginning to understand that the forces opposing N. A. Morozov were all the more formidable to have needed the participation of A. N. Kolmogorov."
> — [History of the New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html)

**Immanuel Velikovsky** accepted Scaligerian modern chronology while challenging ancient chronology, leaving the core falsification intact.

---

### Wilhelm Kammeyer (1889–1959)

German jurist **Kammeyer** applied forensic document analysis to medieval German charters and found that a systematic majority of documents dated before the 12th century are **forgeries** — identifiable by anachronistic legal formulae, postdated seal-types, and inconsistent parchment. The forgeries were not random but centrally coordinated — a program to construct documentary pasts for institutions lacking genuine ancient roots. He is the closest pre-Fomenko scholar to a systematic physical evidence argument for fabrication.

### Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko (1945–present)

In 1973, **A.T. Fomenko** (Moscow State University) noticed astrophysicist Robert Newton's article on anomalous lunar acceleration and began researching moon physics. By 1980, he had published work on redacted eclipse dating. In 1981, others joined the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html) project. Fomenko developed **three quantitative methods** for detecting chronological displacement:

1. **Frequency analysis of proper names** — duplicate statistical distributions in dynastic records indicate duplicate chronicles (the same events recorded twice under different names)
2. **Numerical dynasty encoding** — identical reign-length vectors across "independent" dynasties indicate copying
3. **Astronomical eclipse verification** — back-calculated eclipses consistently fall in the medieval period, not classical antiquity

> "A. T. Fomenko had discovered three important chronological shifts, of roughly 333 years, 1053, and 1800 years respectively. These shifts are only inherent to the erroneous chronology of Scaliger-Petavius... It turned out that 'the Scaligerian textbook' was compiled from four copies of one and the same brief chronicle."
> — [History of the New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html)

The 1,053-year shift is the one directly relevant to the Blip. See the [Fomenko author profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.01.00-anatoly-fomenko.md) for his full biography.

## Convergence

Eight independent scholars, four centuries, four countries, five methods (astronomical dating,
textual criticism, document forensics, statistical analysis, linguistic anachronism analysis)
— all pointing to the same structural conclusion: **the Scaligerian timeline covering the first
millennium CE is not a real historical record. It is a constructed chronology, assembled from
displaced copies of genuinely medieval sources, and enforced institutionally because it is the
temporal foundation of every existing political and religious authority that traces its legitimacy
to ancient precedent.**

The Blip — the fabricated gap from 670 BCE to 1053 CE — is what the convergence of all these
methods implies.
