# Building the New Chronology

The case that Scaligerian chronology is fabrication was built over four centuries by independent scholars using different methods, arriving at the same conclusion: the conventional ancient timeline is internally inconsistent, astronomically incorrect, and structurally dependent on circular reasoning.

## The Critics of Scaliger

**De Arcilla (16th c.)** — Spanish scholar who identified contradictions in classical sources within a generation of Scaliger's *Opus de Emendatione Temporum* (1583). Opposition began immediately.

**Isaac Newton (1643–1727)** — Used precession of the equinoxes to date the Argonaut myth to **936 BCE** — 300–400 years later than conventional ~1250 BCE. Established the precedent: **mythological events can be dated by the sky they describe**.

**Jean Hardouin (1646–1729)** — French Jesuit who argued nearly all classical Greek and Roman literature was forged by Benedictine monks in the 13th–14th centuries. Identified anachronisms and cross-referencing errors proving medieval authorship. Condemned by superiors.

**Petr Krekshin (1684–1763)** — Russian court historian who documented contradictions between Russian primary chronicles and the Scaligerian timeline being imposed during Petrine modernization.

**Robert Baldauf (1867–1907)** — Showed "ancient" texts contained vocabulary only current in the 13th–15th centuries. Core argument: classical philology depended on circular self-referencing — texts dated by comparison to other undated texts.

**Edwin Johnson (1842–1901)** — Argued early Christian history was largely fictional — Church Fathers are literary constructions, the canon assembled later than claimed, and monastic scriptoria manufactured "ancient" history.

**N.A. Morozov (1854–1946)** — Russian revolutionary-scientist who spent 25 years in tsarist prisons doing exhaustive astronomical research. His seven-volume *Christ* (1924–1932) argued every ancient eclipse contradicts Scaligerian dating by 1,000–1,800 years, Mediterranean "history" before the 3rd–4th centuries CE is retroactive medieval projection, and ancient zodiacs consistently yield medieval dates. Suppressed by the Soviet establishment despite private acknowledgment by Kolmogorov.

**Wilhelm Kammeyer (1889–1959)** — Applied forensic document analysis to medieval charters, finding a systematic majority before the 12th century are **forgeries** — centrally coordinated, constructing documentary pasts for institutions lacking genuine roots.

## Anatoly Fomenko (1945–present)

In 1973, Fomenko (Moscow State University) noticed Robert Newton's article on anomalous lunar acceleration and began researching redacted eclipse dating. By 1981, the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html) project was underway. Fomenko developed **three quantitative methods**:

1. **Frequency analysis of proper names** — duplicate distributions indicate duplicate chronicles
2. **Numerical dynasty encoding** — identical reign-length vectors indicate copying
3. **Astronomical eclipse verification** — back-calculated eclipses consistently fall in medieval period, not classical antiquity

> "A. T. Fomenko had discovered three important chronological shifts, of roughly 333 years, 1053, and 1800 years respectively... It turned out that 'the Scaligerian textbook' was compiled from four copies of one and the same brief chronicle."

The 1,053-year shift is directly relevant to the Blip. See the [Fomenko profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.01.00-anatoly-fomenko.md).

## Convergence

Eight scholars, four centuries, four countries, five methods (astronomical dating, textual criticism, document forensics, statistical analysis, linguistic anachronism) — all pointing to the same conclusion: **the Scaligerian first-millennium CE timeline is a constructed chronology assembled from displaced copies of medieval sources**. The Blip is what this convergence implies.
