## Primary Contribution

The Saturn Myth — reconstruction of the Golden Age polar configuration from comparative mythology. Talbott's 1980 book *The Saturn Myth* argued that Saturn once occupied a fixed position at Earth's polar axis, appearing as an enormously enlarged stationary "sun" before a catastrophic reconfiguration dispersed the visible planets. He identified consistent cross-cultural archetypes as independent records of the same sky.

## Significance to This Timeline

Talbott's polar configuration framework is the primary mythological scaffold for this entire timeline. The sequence Saturn → Venus → Mars, the structure of the Wheel of Heaven, the World Column, and the Great Catastrophe are all Talbott's formulations, verified through Cook's calendar triangulation and Thornhill's plasma physics.

## Central Contributions

- **The polar configuration** — Saturn, Venus, and Mars aligned along a common polar axis visible from Earth's northern hemisphere in the Golden Age
- **The "Wheel of Heaven"** archetype — appears in Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu, Norse, Maya, and Aztec sources as direct visual record of Saturn's plasma corona and spokes
- **The Great Catastrophe** — the breakup of the polar configuration as the historical event underlying all worldwide flood, fire-from-heaven, and "death of the gods" traditions
- **Mythological convergence** as primary evidentiary method — 30+ unrelated ancient cultures independently describing the same impossible sky means it was observed
