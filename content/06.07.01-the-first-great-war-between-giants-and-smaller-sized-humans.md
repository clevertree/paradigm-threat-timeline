# The First great war between giants and smaller sized humans

This was the first great war between human giants representing the Polytheistic 'Royal' bloodline Christianity descending
back to Christ and the 'apostolic' Monotheistic Christianity of the normal-sized humans. The War concludes in the Battle
of Troy/Jerusalem/TsarGrad with the giant humans winning. The story goes - the giants (Greeks) were having no luck
breaching the walls of TsarGrad (Troy), so they constructed a giant-sized wooden horse as tribute and pretended to flee
back to their homeland in Tartaria. The 'Trojans' brought the horse inside their walls seeing no threat, as the giants
could not possibly be hiding within, and they could not imagine that the giants had already gained the confidence of
the smaller humans to such a degree that the smaller humans would be willing to die on behalf of the giants in this
governance/war *against* giants, but such willing and revenging behavior was the direct result of the Crucifixion of Christ.
