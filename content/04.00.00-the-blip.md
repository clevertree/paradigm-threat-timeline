# The Blip: 7th Century B.C.E. to 10th Century C.E. Never Occurred

B.C.E. 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are actually the same year. After the cataclysms ended, the Deep State jealousy
guarded records in *holy* church vaults, forbidding outsiders from viewing them. As the old *gods* and stories were
forgotten or fell into myth, it became easier for the Deep State to falsify the timeline. As a result of the success of
the Anno Domini Calendar conspiracy, humans today
(including [catastrophist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) authors
like [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://www.velikovsky.info/) and [Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/))
believe the events of *creation* ended over 2700 years ago.

In the model of catastrophism the date of the *end of ancient history* is the same date as the
last cataclysmic event - 670 B.C.E when the final orbit of 365.25 days was reached, and the same date as
the *beginning of modern history* - 1053 C.E. In other words, the age of cataclysm
**ended just under 1000 years ago**.

*Anatoly Fomenko's New Chronology complies with the most rigid scientific standards. It gives a coherent explanation of what we already know. Independent lines of inquiry all lead to the same conclusion. The predictions it makes are confirmed empirically.*

*BCE 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are all the same moment in time — the end of the age of cataclysm — obscured across three different chronological systems by deliberate redaction.*
