# Revelation of the coming Apocalypse

With this new propaganda tool and new weapons, the **Deep State** once again had the means to cause war in Europe. Now
it was time to formulate **the plan**. A *secret* war plan would have been exposed and would have inevitably failed.
Instead, the **Deep State** placed the plan **in plain sight**, for everyone to see (who could read latin). The book of
this *planned apocalypse* is known
as [The Book of Revelation.](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)

In 1486, the Deep State proliferated letters
to [7 major churches](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)
in Asia Minor purporting a revelation of events to come, specifically of an impending large-scale military incursion of
western Europe using [armed cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse) to curtail the
widespread disease by **destroying the diseased**. The priests of the Deep State once again justified the war as a
Religious Crusade ordained by God. They justified the slaughter by portraying the victims of disease as sinners who
would incur God's wrath. For many hundreds of thousands of *marked sinners* in Western Europe, this coming apocalypse
was the **End of Days**. As the impending date approached, those who could afford to escape would flee to America's east
coast on [large flotillas](https://www.history.com/news/christopher-columbus-ships-caravels).

The [RoM strategy](https://exsplanet.blogspot.com/2009/12/revelation-of-method-predictive.html) was highly effective. It
enabled the Deep State to identify and neutralize any would-be resistance to the plan. Those who wished to remain in
Europe and avoid the slaughter would have to give up their ancient traditions and submit to the authority of the Greek
Orthodox Church of the Rus-Horde Empire.
