# Deep State eliminates its enemies

The 16th Century could be described as a period of great conquest by the Deep State. Many of the major plans they had
set in the previous centuries were coming to fruition; By playing East and West against each other, the Deep State now
effectively ruled the governments of both regions and controlled the movements of world populations. They eliminated
most of the Giants and drove the rest into exile. They destroyed their other ideological enemies-*Christians* -and
merged their religion with Deep State Monotheism. There was only *one ruling element* the Deep State did not control -
the Russian aristocracy.
