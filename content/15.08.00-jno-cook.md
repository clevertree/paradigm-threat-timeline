## Primary Contribution

The most detailed chronological reconstruction of Saturnian events with specific calendar dates derived from cross-cultural ancient sources. Cook is the author of the comprehensive online resource [saturniancosmology.org](https://saturniancosmology.org) — a multi-volume reconstruction of the Saturnian polar configuration with specific year assignments for each major event.

## What Cook Contributed That Others Did Not

Cook's unique contribution is **cross-cultural calendar triangulation** — applying Mesoamerican Long Count data, Chinese annals, and Mesopotamian king lists simultaneously against the mythological sequence to produce specific calendar-year dates, rather than the relative sequences Talbott established.

This timeline's event dates in the Golden Age and Dark Ages sections come primarily from Cook's calculations:
- **4077 BCE** — start of the Saturnian polar configuration (Saturn connects to the inner solar system)
- **3147 BCE** — end of the Golden Age, catastrophic breakup
- **685 BCE** — stabilization of Venus and Earth's current orbits (from Rose & Vaughan's Venus Tablets analysis)

## Cook as Synthesizer

*Saturnian Cosmology* is not original independent research but a synthesis of the entire catastrophist tradition:

| Source | Contribution to Cook's framework |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Talbott | Mythological framework and polar configuration model |
| Thornhill | EU physics mechanism |
| Peratt | Plasma archaeology, petroglyph dating |
| de Grazia | Quantavolution framework, historical sequence |
| Cardona | God Star sequence, proto-Saturnian epoch |
| Cochrane | Mars and Venus mythology |
| Stecchini | Venus orbital period analysis |
| Rose & Vaughan | 685 BCE Venus stabilization date |

## The Site

The site has been continuously revised since 2001, reaching revision 42.42 as of 2024 — the most current living synthesis of the Saturnian chronology literature.
