# Core Concepts

This project rests on eight hard claims. If any one is false, the project fails. We apply the same standard the [SAFIRE Project](/content/00.overview/00.02.03-challenging-established-physics.md) applied: empirical observation, physical replicability, no interpretive exceptions.

## The Eight Falsifiable Propositions

### 1. Saturn was Earth's original polar companion

Before 4,077 BC, Saturn occupied a position directly above Earth's north pole in a collinear electromagnetic alignment including Venus and Mars — the Golden Age, the World Tree, the Axis Mundi, the Polar Sun. **If false:** Every mythological correlation collapses.

### 2. Earth's orbital year length changed in discrete steps

The orbital period changed in quantized jumps — 225, 240, 260, 273, 360, 365.24 days — each triggered by electromagnetic close-encounters. Ancient cultures reformed calendars after each jump. **If false:** The Sumerian king-list numbers are meaningless, the Tzolkin is arbitrary, and the convergence of independent calendar reforms is coincidence.

### 3. The Solar System operates on electromagnetic, not purely gravitational, physics

Planets are charged bodies in the Sun's plasma environment. Close approaches produce plasma discharges and orbital perturbations — the same physics the SAFIRE Project demonstrated at bell-jar scale. **If false:** There is no mechanism for orbital jumps, fossilisation events, or the catastrophe record.

### 4. Ancient mythology is literal astronomical testimony

The gods, monsters, sky-battles, and creation events in every culture's texts are eyewitness accounts of real plasma events, not metaphors or psychology. **If false:** The primary source base is worthless as historical data.

### 5. Multiple catastrophic global events occurred within the human record

The World Flood (~3,147 BC), Venus encounters (~2,349 BC, ~2,193 BC, ~1,492 BC), Mars encounters (~776–686 BC), and the 1774 CE petrification event are real physical events within human memory. **If false:** The catastrophes defining this project's chapter structure never happened on the required timescale.

### 6. Conventional dating methods require recalibration

Radiocarbon, dendrochronology, and stratigraphy all assume a stable orbital environment. If Earth's orbit was shorter in antiquity — closer to the Sun, higher solar flux — then C-14 production rates, tree-ring widths, and varve counts were all different. **If false:** Conventional dates stand uncorrected.

### 7. The conventional timeline has been artificially extended

[Illig's Phantom Time](/content/00.overview/00.03.02-timeline-synchronization.md) (~297 years fabricated) is correct in substance. The broader Fomenko claim — that Scaligerian chronology extends antiquity by centuries through phantom duplications — is also correct. For detailed comparison, see [Other Challenges to Chronology](/content/04.the-blip/04.02.00-other-challenges-to-chronology.md). **If false:** Timeline synchronization is invalid and cross-cultural calendar convergences may be independent events.

### 8. Fossilisation is an electrical, rapid process

Evidence from the Alberta power-line incident (E.R. Milton), Peter Mungo Jupp's research, and Thornhill's fulgurite demonstrations shows fossilisation occurs instantaneously under sufficient electrical discharge. The SAFIRE Project confirmed plasma can transmute elements, supporting the underlying physics. **If false:** Deep time is real and the fossil record is millions of years old.

## How They Interlock

These are not independent — they form a single structure:

- **Proposition 3** (plasma physics) provides the mechanism for 1, 2, and 5
- **Proposition 1** (Saturn configuration) is the origin point of 5's catastrophe sequence
- **Proposition 2** (variable year) provides the chronological key making 7 (phantom time) solvable
- **Proposition 4** (mythology as testimony) provides the source base for 5's dating
- **Proposition 6** (dating recalibration) is the methodological consequence of 2
- **Proposition 8** (rapid fossilisation) is the geological consequence of 3 and 5

Disprove the mechanism (Proposition 3) and the entire structure falls at once.

## What We Do Not Claim

This project does not require a specific theology, agreement on which mythological source is most accurate, literal correctness of any particular Fomenko chronology, or Young-Earth Creationism. It requires only that the eight propositions survive empirical scrutiny.
