# Core Concepts

This project rests on a small number of hard claims. They are stated here without qualification, because none deserve qualification. If any one of them is false, the project fails. We apply the same standard of evidence the [SAFIRE Project](/content/00.overview/00.02.03-challenging-established-physics.md) applied to the Electric Sun model: empirical observation, physical replicability, no interpretive exceptions.

## The Eight Falsifiable Propositions

### 1. Saturn was Earth's original polar companion

Before 4,077 BC, the planet Saturn occupied a position directly above Earth's north pole in a collinear electromagnetic alignment — a configuration also including Venus and Mars. This is what every ancient culture recorded as the Golden Age, the World Tree, the Axis Mundi, the Polar Sun, and the "sun that never moved." The configuration was stable, electrically active, and visible as a stationary luminous body in the northern sky.

**If this is false:** Every mythological correlation in this timeline is coincidence. The entire pre-3147 BC record collapses.

### 2. Earth's orbital year length changed in discrete steps

The Earth's orbital period was not always 365.24 days. It changed in quantized jumps — 225, 240, 260, 273, 360, 365.24 days — each triggered by an electromagnetic close-encounter with another charged planetary body. Ancient cultures worldwide reformed their calendars after each jump and preserved the prior year-count in surviving ritual calendars.

**If this is false:** The Sumerian king-list numbers are meaningless. The Tzolkin is an arbitrary invention. The convergence of independent calendar reforms across unconnected civilizations at the same dates is an elaborate coincidence. The project's entire chronological reconstruction collapses.

---

### 3. The Solar System operates on electromagnetic, not purely gravitational, physics

Planets are charged bodies embedded in the Sun's plasma environment. Their mutual interactions are primarily electromagnetic. Close planetary approaches produce plasma discharges, electrostatic repulsion, and orbital perturbations. The same physics that operates in a laboratory plasma chamber — and that the SAFIRE Project demonstrated at the scale of a bell jar — scales to the planetary level.

**If this is false:** There is no mechanism for orbital jumps. There is no mechanism for the fossilisation events. The catastrophe record has no physical engine. The project has no causal model.

---

### 4. Ancient mythology is literal astronomical testimony

The gods, monsters, dragons, sky-battles, world-floods, and creation events described in every ancient culture's foundational texts are not metaphors, not psychology, not seasonal agriculture allegory. They are eyewitness accounts of observable plasma formations and real physical events in the sky, recorded in the symbolic vocabulary available to the people who saw them.

**If this is false:** The primary source base of this project — which is predominantly mythological and indigenous — is worthless as historical data. The entire reconstruction from Chapter 1 onward has no evidential foundation.

---

### 5. Multiple catastrophic global events occurred within the human record

The World Flood (~3,147 BC), the Venus encounters (~2,349 BC, ~2,193 BC, ~1,492 BC), the Mars encounters (~776–686 BC), and the 1774 CE petrification event are real physical events that happened within the span of human habitation, memory, and record-keeping. They are not geological epochs from millions of years ago. They are recent.

**If this is false:** The geological and fossil record does not belong to this timeline. The catastrophes that define the chapter structure of this project never happened on the timescale required.

---

### 6. Conventional dating methods require recalibration for a variable-year past

Radiocarbon dating, dendrochronology, and stratigraphic dating all assume a stable past orbital environment. They are internally consistent within that assumption. If Earth's orbit was shorter in antiquity — if the planet was closer to the Sun, receiving higher solar flux — then C-14 production rates, tree-ring widths per year, and varve counts per year were all different. Dates derived from these methods for pre-747 BC events are systematically wrong and must be recalibrated against the variable-year model.

**If this is false:** The conventional scientific dates stand uncorrected, and this project's alternative chronology cannot be reconciled with the physical record.

---

### 7. The conventional historical timeline has been artificially extended

[Heribert Illig's Phantom Time hypothesis](/content/00.overview/00.03.02-timeline-synchronization.md) — that approximately 297 years (CE 614–911) were fabricated by Holy Roman political actors — is correct in substance, even if some boundary dates require adjustment. The broader Fomenko claim, that the Scaligerian timeline extends antiquity by centuries through phantom duplications and deliberate redaction, is also correct in substance. The spread between competing ancient creation dates (~5969 BC to ~3102 BC) is largely explained by textual manipulation under conquest, not genuine disagreement about observable events.

**If this is false:** The timeline synchronization methodology of this project is invalid. The cross-cultural calendar convergences we interpret as corroboration of the same events may instead be independent, genuinely separated events.

---

### 8. Fossilisation is an electrical, rapid process — not a slow geological one

The geological mainstream holds that fossilisation requires millions of years of sediment compression. The evidence from the Alberta power-line incident (E.R. Milton), Peter Mungo Jupp's electric-petrification research, and the SAFIRE Project's plasma chemistry demonstrations shows that fossilisation — the replacement of organic material with mineral — occurs instantaneously under sufficient electrical discharge. The global fossil record was produced by the catastrophic events within this timeline, not by deep time.

**If this is false:** Deep time is real. The fossil record is millions of years old. This project's catastrophist chronology cannot account for the geological column and must be abandoned or severely restricted in scope.

## How These Eight Propositions Interlock

They are not independent. They form a single structure:

- Proposition 3 (plasma physics) provides the **mechanism** for Propositions 1, 2, and 5.
- Proposition 1 (Saturn configuration) is the **origin point** of Proposition 5's catastrophe sequence.
- Proposition 2 (variable year) provides the **chronological key** that makes Proposition 7 (phantom time) solvable.
- Proposition 4 (mythology as testimony) provides the **primary source base** that Proposition 5 draws its dating from.
- Proposition 6 (dating recalibration) is the **methodological consequence** of Proposition 2 being true.
- Proposition 8 (rapid fossilisation) is the **geological consequence** of Proposition 3 and Proposition 5 combined.

Disprove any one, and the load it was carrying falls on the others. Disprove the mechanism (Proposition 3) and the entire structure falls at once.

## What We Do Not Claim

This project does not require:

- A specific theological interpretation of the events.
- Agreement on which specific mythological source is most accurate.
- Any particular version of Fomenko's chronology to be literally correct.
- Young-Earth Creationism, though the project is compatible with a young Solar System cycle.

The project requires only that the eight propositions above survive empirical scrutiny. If they do, the alternative chronology presented here is not an alternative — it is the record.
