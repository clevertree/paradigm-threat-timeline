# The Third Story

David Talbott's keynote at the **EU2012 Conference: The Human Story** argued that all of human intellectual history has played out as a contest between exactly two stories — and that both are incomplete.

## The Two Dominant Stories

**Story One — Mythology and Religion:** The oldest human record is saturated with cosmic dramas: gods at war, catastrophic floods, fire from heaven, creation and destruction cycles. Every ancient culture insisted divine powers ruled from the sky and eventually departed — and that the archaic sky bore no resemblance to today's.

**Story Two — Rational Science:** The predictable modern sky offered no support for myth. Science arose from that scepticism and transformed the world. By the 20th century, the standard narrative demanded you choose a side: science vs. myth.

Talbott's claim: *both* are incomplete. Neither can be understood without a third.

## The Key Anomaly

Every ancient culture shared specific mythic archetypes — the Golden Age, the World Mountain, the Dragon, the Divine Warrior, the Wheel of Heaven, the Cosmic Thunderbolt — that are cross-cultural and mutually reinforcing, yet nothing in the current sky explains them. **Cross-cultural agreement at the level of specific detail cannot be coincidence.** Divergent civilisations independently preserving identical imagery must be recording a shared experience.

## Saturn, Venus, and Mars

Following Velikovsky's work on planetary instability, Talbott established that:

- **Saturn was the original "sun."** The Babylonian *Shamash* (sun god) was explicitly Saturn in the magical texts. Greek *Helios* and Latin *Sol* referred to Saturn in earliest usage — undisputed by mainstream scholars.
- **The Golden Age = the age of Saturn as polar sun.** Life "in the time of Kronos" describes a prior epoch of peace and stable celestial order.
- **The planets were in a collinear polar alignment.** Ancient depictions describe planets standing in a vertical axial stack — the mythological World Tree, Axis Mundi, and cosmic pillar.

**Venus** appeared as a terrifying great comet — the *mother of comets*. Long flowing hair, feathers, serpentine form, fiery breath: universal comet symbols applied globally to Venus in earliest sources.

**Mars** was the warrior god whose weapon — Sanskrit *vajra*, Greek thunderbolt, Odin's bolt, Indra's weapon — was the **cosmic thunderbolt**: a bipolar plasma discharge form visible in the sky and reproducible in laboratory plasma experiments, with embedded cylinders, pinch points, and bipolar symmetry.

## Plasma Connection: Rock Art and Anthony Peratt

Anthony Peratt (Los Alamos) matched tens of thousands of rock-art images worldwide to plasma discharge formations reproducible in the laboratory. The **stick-man/squatting-man** petroglyph (universal from Hawaii to Saudi Arabia) = a cross-section of a toroidal plasma column. The **chain of arrows** / ladder of heaven = stacked tori along an axial discharge filament, confirmed in declassified supercomputer simulations.

Peratt's investigation was entirely independent of Talbott's mythology work. Their convergence at precise morphological detail — beginning when Talbott sent Peratt a single rock-art image in 2000 — is presented as a falsification test: accidental agreement at this specificity is not possible.

## The Third Story

> *"The first story will never be understood in the absence of the Electric Universe. The second story must be rewritten in the light of the Electric Universe."*

The third story requires: (1) mythology as literal sky-testimony, (2) a recently unstable solar system, (3) Electric Universe physics as the causal framework, (4) interdisciplinary convergence across myth, plasma physics, rock art, calendar data, and laboratory experiment, and (5) open peer review rather than institutional gatekeeping.
