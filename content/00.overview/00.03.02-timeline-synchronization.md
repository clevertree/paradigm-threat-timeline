# Timeline synchronization

Due to deliberate [destruction of indigenous culture](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-resistance-new-colonialism) by the Holy Roman Empire and its predecessors, we have conflicting dates for "Creation":

**~5500 B.C. cluster** (Septuagint-based): Antiochian (5969), Byzantine (5508), Alexandrian (5493), Jerome (5199)
**~3100–4100 B.C. cluster** (indigenous/pre-Hellenistic): Ussher (4004), Judaic (3761), Maya Long Count (3114), Hindu Kali Yuga (3102), Egyptian (c. 3000)

## Why the Dates Diverge

The ~3,900-year spread is evidence that **whoever controlled records controlled the calendar**. The number of years since Creation determined political legitimacy, prophetic authority, and colonial erasure.

The ~1,500-year gap between the **Septuagint** (~5500 B.C.) and **Masoretic Text** (~4000 B.C.) clusters is explained by textual manipulation, not cosmological difference. The Septuagint (c. 280 B.C.) uses longer genealogical lifespans than the Masoretic Text (finalized c. AD 1000). The Greek church fathers worked from the Septuagint; Jewish/Protestant chronologists worked from the Masoretic. Both were politically managed. **The 1,500-year gap is a textual artifact of competing empires.**

### What the Conquerors Burned

- **Bishop Diego de Landa, 1562** — burned virtually all Maya codices at Maní; only four survived
- **Library of Alexandria** — burned multiple times; pre-Ptolemaic records lost
- **Nineveh, 621 B.C.** — Babylonian astronomical records discarded as "unreliable" because they described a sky that no longer matched post-catastrophe observations
- **Aztec codices** — systematically burned after 1521

In every case, destruction was followed by **rewriting history from a new year zero**.

## The Original Dates Were Closer Together

Once manufactured genealogical inflation and deliberate destruction are removed, the surviving dates cluster tighter. The 5500–5969 B.C. cluster is produced by adding ~1,400–1,900 years to patriarchal genealogies in the Greek translation. Strip that out and it collapses toward the second cluster (~3100–4100 B.C.), which spans only ~975 years across civilizations separated by oceans with no documented contact — all describing the same catastrophic events during the Saturnian polar configuration's final phase.

## Creation Was a Process, Not a Moment

[Jno Cook's reconstruction](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php) identifies different civilizations establishing year-zero at different chapters of the same ~8,000-year sequence:

| Event | Date | Who counted from this |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| Saturn drops coma, goes nova — "sun first shows itself" | **4077 B.C.** | Quiche Maya |
| World Flood: polar configuration collapses | **3147 B.C.** | Maya Long Count, Sumerian tradition |
| Fall of the Absu: "flood of Noah" | **2349 B.C.** | Biblical/Babylonian tradition |
| End of Mars-Earth conflicts; skies go quiet | **685 B.C.** | "Start of history, science, and philosophy" |

> *"In 4077 BC Saturn dropped its coma... Saturn went nova and lit up more brilliantly than the Sun. To humans who had not clearly seen the real Sun for thousands of years, this was the start of creation, the start of time."* — Jno Cook

Creation myths worldwide describe **the same observable phenomena**: great darkness before creation (Saturn's coma), sudden light in the north (Saturn going nova), central tree/pillar/axis of the world (polar plasma column), a flood destroying the prior world, a new sky after catastrophe (modern solar system post-685 B.C.).

The thousands of years of apparent disagreement collapse once you understand that **conquerors added years to push the origin back, destroyed records preserving original dates, and imposed new calendars severing peoples from their chronology.**

This project uses [Jno Cook's reconstructed timeline](https://saturniancosmology.org/short.htm) starting with a creation date of [4077 B.C.](https://saturniancosmology.org/rec.php#rec-c25h) based on the Quiche Maya. His [Recovering the Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Lost-World-Jno-Cook/dp/0997237910) reconstructs events using indigenous records from those who were alive when it happened.
