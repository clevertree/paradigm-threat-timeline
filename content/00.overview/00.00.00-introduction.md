I started this timeline project because I had faith since I was young that technology can solve any human problem.

I was born and raised Jewish. The faith was hard for me to accept — things didn't quite add up. At the same time, I was drawn to the emerging technologies of the 1980s: computers and software, which *did* add up. They were causal, logical, honest. Since then, technology has become my religion.

But other things didn't add up either. History, for example. It seemed to cycle endlessly — the same patterns of war, oppression, and collapse repeating across centuries — implying that the human species was either unwilling or unable to learn anything from the horrors of the past, falling for the rouse that the species had a greedy warlike natur that could not be mitigated without some sort of unified world order.

I watched the same thing happen in the software world. Instead of progressing in the most efficient and equitable direction, we kept getting channeled into substandard, artificial experiences controlled by corporations. The technology I believed in — the one that should have liberated — was systematically captured and shaped by concentrated power. This was not how I intended it to turn out.

If the history was written by the victors, then hundreds of years of warfare could only have produced a highly redacted, winner's-eye view of the past — scrubbed, compressed, and reordered to serve those who controlled the record-keeping.

As a software developer, I'm wired toward causality and functionality. I want to know *why* something works the way it does, and I want to trace the chain back to its origin. In the software world, there are no biases — or at least, there shouldn't be. Code either runs or it doesn't. Cause follows effect. Proof is in the pudding.

What actually pushed me in this direction was censorship. Around 2010, I noticed a flourishing of controversial ideas on Facebook, Google+, and the early social web — everything from Hollow Earth to unorthodox WW2 history to suppressed science. Then, within a year or two, all of it disappeared. Not organically. Systematically. Shadowbanned, permabanned, demonetized, downvoted, downranked — every mechanism available was deployed against specific topics with striking consistency. I started collecting those materials before they vanished, building an archive I eventually released publicly as the **Paradigm Threat Repository**.

The aggression of that censorship was, paradoxically, the most clarifying signal I received. When a topic is ignored, it may simply be fringe. When a topic is *actively suppressed*, with coordinated effort across every major platform simultaneously, it means something else entirely. The sheer blatancy of it could only point in one direction: the "first story" (mainstream consensus) and the "second story" (conspiracy counter-narrative) are both managed — a divide-and-conquer structure designed to exhaust us in arguments between two controlled positions, and prevent us from perceiving a third story altogether.

Applying that same principle to history — and applying the full stack of modern software tools, especially AI agents to OCR scan new and old books in multiple languages and cross-reference studies and conclusions — I set out to piece together a potentially highly redacted history of Earth. This timeline is the result of that investigation.
