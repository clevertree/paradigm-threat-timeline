# Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm

These researchers argue that ancient myth, scripture, sacred art, geology, and archaeology are eyewitness records of real planetary events and cosmic disasters within the last 12,000 years. Also includes researchers who challenge mainstream dating AND interpret cataclysm. Chronological work summarized in [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](/content/00.overview/00.02.01-authors-challenging-chronology.md).

## The Core Saturnian Network

**Wal Thornhill** — Physicist, co-founder of the Thunderbolts Project. Developed the Electric Universe model providing the plasma physics mechanism for the Saturnian polar configuration. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.02.00-wal-thornhill.md)

**Ralph Juergens** (1924–1979) — Originated the Electric Sun hypothesis: the Sun powered by external galactic current rather than thermonuclear fusion. Foundation for understanding planetary electrical exchanges. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.03.00-ralph-juergens.md)

**David Talbott** — Primary architect of the Saturn Myth reconstruction. Established through comparative mythology that Saturn, Venus, and Mars were arrayed along Earth's polar axis in the Golden Age. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.06.00-david-talbott.md)

**Dwardu Cardona** (1937–2018) — Extended Talbott's reconstruction into the pre-configuration "God Star" era when Saturn was a lone protosun. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.15.00-dwardu-cardona.md)

**Jno Cook** — Most detailed Saturnian chronology. Synthesized Talbott-Thornhill-Cardona-Cochrane and applied cross-cultural calendar triangulation to produce specific dates. Primary source for this timeline's opening chapters. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.08.00-jno-cook.md)

## Foundation Texts

**Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend** — *Hamlet's Mill* (1969) established that ancient myth reliably encodes precise astronomical observation. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.12.00-de-santillana-von-dechend.md)

**Immanuel Velikovsky** (1895–1979) — Established Venus as a recently displaced comet, Exodus plagues as near-miss planetary catastrophe, and myth as non-allegory. His suppression set the template all catastrophists after him navigated. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.04.00-immanuel-velikovsky.md)

## Physical Science

**Anthony Peratt** — Plasma physicist (Los Alamos). Demonstrated ancient petroglyphs worldwide match laboratory plasma discharge forms. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.07.00-anthony-peratt.md)

**Donald Scott** — Engineering-grade formalization of the EU model into testable plasma engineering terms. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.10.00-donald-scott.md)

**Martinus van der Sluijs** — Extended Peratt's petroglyph work into ancient texts documenting the world column and cosmic axis. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.20.00-martinus-van-der-sluijs.md)

## Mythological Analysis

**Ev Cochrane** — Comparative mythology of Mars and Venus: cross-cultural "multi-armed warrior goddess" as Venus at plasma discharge, "cosmic dragon-slayer" as Mars. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.11.00-ev-cochrane.md)

## Astronomical & Metrological

**Livio Stecchini** (1913–1979) — Babylonian Venus records encode orbital periods inconsistent with current orbit; ancient measurement systems encode advanced geodetic knowledge. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.17.00-livio-stecchini.md)

**Lynn Rose & Raymond Vaughan** — Mathematical derivation of the **685 BCE Venus orbital stabilization date** from the Venus Tablets of Ammizaduga. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.18.00-rose-vaughan.md)

**Tom Van Flandern** (1940–2009) — Exploded Planet Hypothesis: the asteroid belt is debris of a former planet, Mars its former moon. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.19.00-tom-van-flandern.md)

## Catastrophism from Within Mainstream

**Victor Clube & Bill Napier** — Oxford/Armagh astronomers arguing the Taurid meteor complex is a fragmented giant comet that catastrophically bombarded Bronze Age and early medieval civilizations. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.16.00-clube-napier.md)

## Systematizers & Defenders

**Alfred de Grazia** (1919–2014) — Coined "quantavolution"; 15-volume series systematizing catastrophist research. Documented Velikovsky's suppression. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.09.00-alfred-de-grazia.md)

**Charles Ginenthal** — Definitive published rebuttal of Sagan's 1974 AAAS takedown of Velikovsky. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.21.00-charles-ginenthal.md)

## Both: Chronology Challenge AND Cataclysm

**Anatoly Fomenko** (b. 1945) — Mathematical proof Scaligerian chronology is fabrication + framework placing Christ in 12th-century Constantinople and the Mongol Empire as the Russian-Horde. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.05.00-anatoly-fomenko.md)

**Gunnar Heinsohn** (b. 1943) — Stratigraphic proof 1st millennium BCE "ghost empires" lack distinct layers + catastrophic event ~930–940 CE. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.14.00-gunnar-heinsohn.md)

**Robert Schoch** (b. 1959) — Sphinx re-dated to 7,000–10,000 BCE + solar plasma outburst hypothesis (~9,700 BCE). [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.22.00-robert-schoch.md)

**Graham Hancock** (b. 1950) — Advanced civilization destroyed by Younger Dryas impact (~10,900 BCE); Atlantis, flood myths, and monument alignments as literal records. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.23.00-graham-hancock.md)

**Michael Cremo** (b. 1948) — Suppressed evidence for multi-million-year human antiquity; Vedic literature as literal cosmic history. [→ Profile](/content/15-author-profiles/15.24.00-michael-cremo.md)
