# The length of a Year changes throughout Antiquity

The Earth's orbit changed over time — from the collinear Saturnian configuration (Golden Age) through electromagnetic close-encounters with Venus and Mars, into its final stable orbit. With each *jump*, calendar year-length changed dramatically, and ancient cultures worldwide reformed their calendars to match.

Time-keeping only became possible at **4,077 BC**, when Saturn was electrically ignited and began to visibly turn in Earth's sky. Before that, Saturn was present but inert. There is no surviving calendar or astronomical record from before this date because *no time was being reckoned*.

> The whole idea of even suggesting that the length of the year could have changed in the past comes from the solidly established changes seen in the 8th century B.C.E., when worldwide calendars of 360 days were superseded by calendars of 365 days plus one quarter day.

## Solar Year Variables

| Period (BC) | Days/year | Orbit (AU) | Era |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before 4,077 | — | ~0.72 | Pre-ignition: no time reckoning |
| 4,077 – 3,147 | 225 | 0.72 | Saturn ignition / Golden Age |
| 3,147 – 2,349 | 240 | 0.75 | Old Kingdom (post-flood, no Moon) |
| 2,349 – 2,193 | 260 | 0.79 | Fall of the Absu / Moon appears |
| 2,193 – 1,492 | 273 | 0.83 | Middle Kingdom |
| 1,492 – 747 | 360 | 0.99 | New Kingdom / Exodus era |
| 747 BC – today | 365.24 | 1.00 | Current era |

## The Mechanism: Plasma Interactions and Orbital Jumps

Each transition was caused by an electromagnetic close-encounter. When a larger charged body passed close enough, Earth's plasmasphere interacted with it, producing electric repulsion that shifted Earth's orbit outward. No collision was required — only a close pass through intersecting plasmaspheres.

| Date | Agent | Event |
|---|---|---|
| ~3,147 BC | Jupiter–Saturn collision | World Flood; Saturn removed; 225→240 days |
| ~2,349 BC | Venus | Noah's Flood; Moon appears; 240→260 days |
| ~2,193 BC | Venus | Fall of Akkad; 260→273 days |
| ~1,492 BC | Venus (Central Pacific) | Exodus; 273→360 days |
| ~747 BC | Mars | Era of Nabonassar; 360→365.24 days |

## Theory: Planetary Orbits as Electron Shells

![Planets act like Electrons](/media/00.overview/planets-act-like-electrons.png)

The pattern of discrete orbital jumps — stable configurations persisting for centuries, triggered by external charged bodies, with no intermediate states — is structurally identical to electron behaviour in atoms. Each era represents a stable configuration; each jump was caused by an external charged body; no "234-day year" appears in any record. The orbital radii (0.72, 0.75, 0.79, 0.83, 0.99, 1.00 AU) represent allowed configurations within the Sun's electric field. If the Electric Universe model is correct, **there is no separate "quantum mechanics" and "celestial mechanics"** — one set of rules operates at atomic and cosmic scale.

## Era Highlights

**225-day year (Golden Age, 4077–3147 BC):** Earth at ~0.72 AU — where Venus now sits. No Moon. Sumerian King Lists' pre-flood reign-lengths become consistent only with 225-day years.

**240-day year (Old Kingdom, 3147–2349 BC):** Post-Jupiter–Saturn catastrophe; orbit expanded to ~0.75 AU. Ancient Chinese records describe four seasons of 60 days (4×60=240).

**260-day year (Fall of the Absu, 2349–2193 BC):** Venus close-approach; Moon appeared for the first time. The **Mesoamerican Tzolkin** (260-day ritual calendar, still in use) preserves this era's year-length exactly.

**273-day year (Middle Kingdom, 2193–1492 BC):** Chinese Shang oracle bones record months of 27–28 days. Human gestation (~273 days) may preserve a calibration memory.

**360-day year (New Kingdom, 1492–747 BC):** The most documented era. **The 360 degrees of circular measure we use today is based on this period.** Babylon, Egypt (36 decans × 10 days), Maya Long Count (360-day *Tun*), India, China, and Rome all record the same structure.

**365.24-day year (747 BC–present):** Final jump ~Feb 27, 747 BC (Era of Nabonassar). Olmec Long Count confirms the same date (Feb 28, 747 BC). Five epagomenal days added worldwide.

## The Canopus Decree (239 BC)

In 239 BC, Ptolemy III ordered one leap day every four years, explicitly referring to "the year of 360 days and the 5 days added to their end" — confirming Egypt understood its 365-day calendar as a *modified* 360-day calendar.

## Carbon-14 Corroboration

Jno Cook compared dates calculated using progressively shorter years against the **INTCAL98 radiocarbon calibration table** and found strong agreement back to ~4077 BC. The C-14 curve's "wiggles" align with year-length boundary events when adjusted for each era's actual year length — independent physical corroboration of Earth being closer to the Sun in ancient times.

## Summary

The convergence of independent evidence — Sumerian king lists, Chinese oracle bones, Mesoamerican ritual calendars, Egyptian records, Babylonian tablets, and Roman calendar structure — all pointing to the same sequence of year-length changes, constitutes one of the most robust arguments in alternative chronology research.
