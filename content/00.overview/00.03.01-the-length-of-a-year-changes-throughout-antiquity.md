# The length of a Year changes throughout Antiquity

The Earth's orbit changed over time—from the collinear Saturnian configuration (Golden Age) through a series of
electromagnetic close-encounters with Venus and Mars, and into its final stable orbit in modern times.
With each *jump*, the number of days in a calendar year changed dramatically, and ancient cultures worldwide reformed
their calendars to match.

Time-keeping itself only became possible at **4,077 BC**, when Saturn was electrically ignited and began to visibly
turn in Earth's sky. Before that moment, Saturn was present but inert—unlit, unmoving in appearance. The flow of
electric current through the planetary chain—Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn arrayed pole-to-pole in a collinear
configuration—energised the system like a circuit completing, causing Saturn to blaze into visibility and rotate.
There is no surviving calendar, king-list, or astronomical record from before this date because *no time was being
reckoned*.

## Solar Year Variables

The following table summarizes each era's calendar parameters and Earth's estimated orbital radius.
All dates are approximate; Scaligerian dates are used as a working framework pending full chronological reconciliation.

| Period (BC) | Days/year | Days/month | Months/year | Orbit (AU) | Era |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Before 4,077 | — | — | — | ~0.72 | Pre-ignition: Saturn unlit; no time reckoning possible |
| 4,077 – 3,147 | 225 | — | — | 0.72 | Saturn ignition / Golden Age |
| 3,147 – 2,349 | 240 | — | — | 0.75 | Old Kingdom (post-flood, no Moon) |
| 2,349 – 2,193 | 260 | 26 | 10? | 0.79 | Fall of the Absu / Moon appears |
| 2,193 – 1,492 | 273 | 27–28 | 10 | 0.83 | Middle Kingdom / Fall of Akkad |
| 1,492 – 747 | 360 | 30 | 12 | 0.99 | New Kingdom / Exodus era |

## The Mechanism: Plasma Interactions and Orbital Jumps

Each transition in year-length was caused by an electromagnetic close-encounter between Earth and another solar-system
body. When a larger charged body passed sufficiently close, Earth's plasmasphere interacted with it, resulting in
electric repulsion that shifted Earth's orbit outward. The orbital radius increased, which lengthened the year.

The agents of each jump, from Jno Cook's impact table:

| Date | Agent | Event |
|---|---|---|
| ~3,147 BC | Jupiter–Saturn collision | World Flood; Saturn removed from polar axis; 225→240 days |
| ~2,349 BC | Venus (strike near Tibet) | Noah's Flood; Moon appears in sky; 240→260 days |
| ~2,193 BC | Venus | Fall of Akkad / Egyptian Old Kingdom collapse; 260→273 days |
| ~1,492 BC | Venus (strike Central Pacific) | Exodus; 273→360 days |
| ~747 BC | Mars | Era of Nabonassar; 360→365.24 days |
| ~686 BC | Mercury | Sennacherib / Phaethon event |

> Plasma contact between large charged bodies causes electrostatic repulsion. Earth was literally pushed to a slightly
> larger orbit during each near-collision with Venus or Mars, adding days to the year. No collision was required—only
> a close pass through intersecting plasmaspheres.

## Theory: Planetary Orbits as Electron Shells

![Planets act like Electrons](/media/00.overview/planets-act-like-electrons.png)

The pattern of Earth's orbital jumps — discrete leaps between stable orbits triggered by electromagnetic encounters — is structurally identical to electron behaviour in atoms. Each era (225, 240, 260, 273, 360, 365.24 days) represents a stable configuration that persisted for centuries; each jump was caused by an external charged body (Venus, Mars, Jupiter); no intermediate states ("234-day year" or "300-day year") appear in any calendar record. The orbital radii (0.72, 0.75, 0.79, 0.83, 0.99, 1.00 AU) represent allowed configurations within the Sun's electric field, analogous to discrete electron shells. If the Electric Universe model is correct — if planets are charged bodies orbiting within the Sun's plasmasphere — then **there is no separate "quantum mechanics" and "celestial mechanics."** There is one set of rules operating identically at atomic and cosmic scale.

## Era by Era

### 4,077 – 3,147 BC: The 225-Day Year (Saturn Ignition / Golden Age)

Earth's orbital radius: ~0.72 AU (where Venus now sits). No Moon. The era begins at **4,077 BC** when Saturn was electrically ignited — the cosmological moment ancient peoples remembered as the first sunrise. The Sumerian King Lists' fantastically large pre-flood reign numbers become consistent only when a 225-day year is used. The coincidence with Venus's current orbit (0.72 AU, ~225 days) is significant: Earth in the Golden Age occupied the orbital slot Venus now holds.

### 3,147 – 2,349 BC: The 240-Day Year (Old Kingdom)

The Jupiter–Saturn catastrophe of ~3,147 BC ended the Golden Age and produced the World Flood. Earth's orbit expanded to ~0.75 AU. The post-flood Sumerian King Lists fit a 240-day year. Ancient Chinese records describe four seasons of 60 days each (4 × 60 = 240). The *Annals of Shu* record Emperor Yao sending astronomers to measure the new year. No Moon yet appears in this era.

### 2,349 – 2,193 BC: The 260-Day Year (Fall of the Absu)

A Venus close-approach drove Earth to ~0.79 AU. The Moon appeared for the first time (~26-day period, ~10 months/year). The **Mesoamerican Tzolkin** (260-day ritual calendar, still in continuous use) preserves this era's year-length exactly. Noah's Flood and the appearance of the rainbow (plasma discharge between Venus and Earth) mark this event across multiple cultures.

### 2,193 – 1,492 BC: The 273-Day Year (Middle Kingdom)

A second Venus interaction shifted orbit to ~0.83 AU. Chinese Shang Dynasty oracle bones record months of 27–28 days. The Mesoamerican 13-division zodiac (13 × 21 = 273 days) independently confirms this year-length. The Old Kingdom collapse coincides with this orbital jump. Human gestation (~273 days) may preserve a calibration memory of this period.

### 1,492 – 747 BC: The 360-Day Year (New Kingdom)

The Exodus-era Venus encounter pushed Earth to ~0.99 AU, yielding 12 months of exactly 30 days. **The 360 degrees of circular measure we use today is based on this era.** This is the most extensively documented calendar era: Babylon divided the ecliptic into 18 × 20 = 360 degrees; Egypt used 36 decans of 10 days; the Maya Long Count preserves the 360-day *Tun* as its base unit; India, China, and Rome all record the same structure. The near-simultaneous addition of 5 days across every calendar-keeping civilisation after 747 BC is one of the strongest proofs the year actually changed.

### 747 BC – Today: The 365.24-Day Year (Current Era)

The final jump occurred ~February 27, 747 BC (Era of Nabonassar), when Mars exerted its last major perturbation. The Olmec Long Count independently confirms the same date (position 6.0.0.0.0 on February 28, 747 BC). Plutarch's formula — Hermes won 1/70th of each day from the Moon, creating 5 additional days (360 × 1/70 ≈ 5.14) — is a mythological encoding of the calendar jump arithmetic. Worldwide Mars mythology (Tiamat, Typhon, Set, Tlaloc) describes this era's terrifying sky-battle.

## The Canopus Decree (239 BC): Surviving Evidence of the Prior 360-Day Calendar

In 239 BC, the Greek pharaoh Ptolemy III issued the *Canopus Decree*—engraved in two languages on stone and
found at Tanis, Egypt—ordering the addition of one leap day every four years to correct calendar drift.

The decree is significant because it explicitly refers to **"the year of 360 days and the 5 days added to
their end"**—confirming that Egypt's 365-day calendar was understood as a modified 360-day calendar.
The five epagomenal days were not original; they were appended *after* 747 BC as an adjustment for the
orbital change.

The decree was rejected by the Egyptian priesthood and never implemented—only institutionalized later when
Augustus Caesar imposed the Julian calendar on Egypt in 23 BC.

## Carbon-14 Corroboration

Jno Cook compared the dates calculated using progressively shorter years (going backward through each era)
against the **INTCAL98 radiocarbon calibration table**—and found strong agreement back to the Old Kingdom
period (~4077 BC). The C-14 calibration curve's visible "wiggles" and offsets, long puzzling to
archaeologists, align with the year-length boundary events when adjusted for each era's actual year length.

This is an independent physical corroboration: the radiometric record of atmospheric C-14 (which depends on
solar exposure) is consistent with Earth being closer to the Sun (shorter years, faster orbit) in ancient
times.

## Summary

| Year-length change | Triggering event | Calendar impact |
|---|---|---|
| 225→240 days (~3,147 BC) | Saturn removed / World Flood | 4×60-day Chinese seasons; Sumerian post-flood kings |
| 240→260 days (~2,349 BC) | Venus pass / Noah's Flood | Tzolkin calendar; Moon appears; 10 months of 26 days |
| 260→273 days (~2,193 BC) | Venus pass / Fall of Akkad | Oracle bone months of 27–28 days; 13×21 Mesoamerican zodiac |
| 273→360 days (~1,492 BC) | Venus pass / Exodus | 12 months of 30 days; 360° circle; worldwide reform |
| 360→365.24 days (~747 BC) | Mars / Nabonassar era | 5 epagomenal days added; current calendar established |

The convergence of independent evidence—Sumerian king lists, Chinese oracle bones, Mesoamerican ritual
calendars, Egyptian administrative records, Babylonian astronomical tablets, and Roman calendar structure—all
pointing to the same sequence of year-length changes, constitutes one of the most robust arguments in
alternative chronology research.
