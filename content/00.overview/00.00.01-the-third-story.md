# The Third Story

David Talbott's keynote at the **EU2012 Conference: The Human Story** (The Thunderbolts Project,
Phoenix, AZ) argued that all of human intellectual history has played out as a contest between
exactly two stories — and that both are incomplete. A third story is now possible.

## The Two Dominant Stories

**Story One — Mythology and Religion:** The oldest human record is saturated with cosmic dramas:
gods at war, catastrophic floods, fire from heaven, creation and destruction cycles. Every ancient
culture insisted that divine powers ruled from the sky, that the gods eventually departed, and that
what had been seen in the archaic sky bore no resemblance to anything visible today. Organised
religion inherited this patrimony but never fully explained it; the myths became increasingly
irrational under a placid modern sky.

**Story Two — Rational Science:** As the predictable, familiar sky offered no support for myth,
scepticism grew. Philosophers and naturalists abandoned the gods. Science arose from that
scepticism and transformed the world. By the 20th century the standard narrative was
*Science vs. Myth and Religion* — a cliché demanding you choose a side.

Talbott's claim: *both* stories are incomplete. Neither can be understood without a third.

## The Key Anomaly: Why the Sky We See Gives No Support to Myth

Every ancient culture shared a set of mythic archetypes — the Golden Age, the World Mountain, the
Dragon in the sky, the Divine Warrior, the Wheel of Heaven, the Cosmic Thunderbolt — that are
specific, cross-cultural, and mutually reinforcing. Yet nothing in the current sky explains them.
Talbott identified this as the central evidentiary puzzle: *hundreds of mythic archetypes that
converge at extraordinary detail, yet correspond to nothing in nature as experienced today.*

His research method: **cross-cultural agreement at the level of specific detail cannot be
coincidence**. Divergent civilisations independently preserving the same imagery — the same
planetary associations, the same sky-forms, the same sequences of events — must be recording a
shared experience.

## Saturn as the Original Sun

Following Immanuel Velikovsky's early work on planetary instability (see *Worlds in Collision*,
and the *Pensée* journal series Talbott published from 1972), Talbott established that:

- **Saturn was the original "sun."** The Babylonian name *Shamash* (sun god) was explicitly the
  planet Saturn in the magical texts. The Greek *Helios* and Latin *Sol* both referred to Saturn
  in earliest usage. Not one scholar disputes the identification, only its *meaning*.
- **The Golden Age = the age of Saturn as polar sun.** Greek accounts of life "in the time of
  Kronos" (= Saturn ruling in heaven) and equivalent traditions worldwide all describe a prior
  epoch of peace, plenty, and stable celestial order.
- **The planets were gathered in a collinear alignment above the pole.** Ancient depictions of a
  great conjunction describe planets standing in a single line — not the 30° arc of a modern
  conjunction, but a polar axial stack. This is what the mythology of the World Tree, Axis Mundi,
  and cosmic pillar preserved.

## Venus and Mars: The Comet and the Warrior

Talbott confirmed Velikovsky's claim that **Venus appeared as a terrifying great comet** —
the *mother of comets*, the source of all subsequent fear attached to wispy comets. The
mythological corpus on Venus is unambiguous: long flowing hair, feathers, serpentine form, fiery
breath — all universal symbols of the comet, and all applied globally to the planet Venus in the
earliest sources.

**Mars** was the prototype of the warrior god: the red warrior whose *weapon* — identified across
cultures (Sanskrit *vajra*, Tibetan *dorje*, Japanese *kongo*, Greek thunderbolt, Odin's bolt,
Indra's weapon) — was not inspired by earthly battle experience. Every ancient warrior-god's
magical weapon was the **cosmic thunderbolt**: a bipolar plasma discharge form visible in the sky
and reproducible in laboratory plasma experiments. The warrior god *is* his weapon; the thunderbolt
form matches high-energy plasma discharge morphology, including:

- Embedded cylinders and tori
- Pinch points and Peratt instabilities
- The "wing" or "Christmas tree" discharge form
- Bipolar symmetry (replicated in the Princeton plasma lab and in space imaging)

## The Plasma Connection: Rock Art and Anthony Peratt

A convergence with independent plasma physics research provided quantitative confirmation.
Anthony Peratt (Los Alamos National Laboratory) matched tens of thousands of rock-art images
worldwide to plasma discharge formations reproducible in the laboratory:

- The **stick-man** / squatting-man petroglyph (universal from Hawaii to Saudi Arabia to the
  American Southwest) = a two-dimensional cross-section of a toroidal plasma discharge column.
- The **twin dots** flanking the stick-man's arms = synchrotron radiation from the torus centre.
- The **duck-headed variants** = the upper champagne-glass termination of the discharge column.
- The **chain of arrows** / backbone of heaven / ladder of heaven = a Peratt instability —
  stacked tori along an axial discharge filament, confirmed in classified and subsequently
  declassified supercomputer simulations.

Peratt's investigation was entirely independent of Talbott's mythology work. Their convergence
at precise morphological detail — beginning with Talbott sending Peratt a single rock-art image
in 2000 — is presented as a *falsification test*: accidental agreement at this level of specificity
is not possible.

## The Third Story: What It Requires

Talbott closed by framing the third story as the necessary synthesis:

> *"The first story will never be understood in the absence of the Electric Universe.
> The second story must be rewritten in the light of the Electric Universe."*

The third story requires:

1. **Reconsideration of mythology as literal sky-testimony** — not metaphor, not psychology, but
   eyewitness records of real plasma events translated into symbolic vocabulary.
2. **Acceptance of a recently unstable solar system** — planetary close-encounters within human
   memory, producing the catastrophes that punctuate and end the mythic ages.
3. **Electric Universe physics** — plasma cosmology, the Electric Sun model, electromagnetic
   orbital mechanics — as the causal framework that makes (1) and (2) physically coherent.
4. **Pattern recognition across disciplines** — interdisciplinary convergence (myth + plasma
   physics + rock art + ancient calendar data + laboratory experiment) rather than siloed
   mathematical elaboration of prior assumptions.
5. **Open peer review** — not the gatekeeping that currently punishes researchers who endorse
   extraordinary but well-evidenced ideas.

The "third story" is neither myth nor conventional science, but the revision of both by the
discovery of what the ancient sky actually looked like and what happened to it.

## Key Claims for Investigation

| Claim | Source | Confidence |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Saturn was called "sun" (Shamash, Helios, Sol) in earliest sources | Babylonian magical texts; Greek/Latin etymology | High — undisputed by mainstream scholars |
| Venus appeared as a great comet within human memory | Velikovsky; cross-cultural mythology | Controversial — consistent with evidence |
| Mars was the warrior god; his weapon = cosmic plasma thunderbolt | Cross-cultural mythology; plasma morphology | Evidence-based; requires EU physics |
| Rock art worldwide = plasma discharge formations | Peratt (2003+); supercomputer matching | Strong quantitative match |
| Collinear planetary alignment at Earth's pole = Golden Age sky | Talbott reconstruction; mythology | Core thesis; not yet in mainstream literature |
