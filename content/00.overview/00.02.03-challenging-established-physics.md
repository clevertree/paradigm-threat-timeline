# Challenging Established Physics

![Challenging Established Physics](/media/00.overview/challenging-established-physics.png)

Scattered across the margins of academic science — underfunded, intermittently suppressed, never integrated into curricula — is experimental and observational evidence that contradicts the foundational assumptions of modern physics, geology, and cosmology. This is not speculation. It comes from **working plasma reactors**, **laboratory demonstrations**, **satellite data**, and **fossil beds**.

Three research threads are relevant to this timeline:

## The SAFIRE Project

The **SAFIRE PROJECT** (Stellar Atmospheric Function In Regulation Experiment) was initiated in 2012 by engineer **Montgomery Childs** with backing from **Scott and Bruce Mainwaring** to test whether the Electric Sun model — where the Sun is powered by plasma interactions rather than internal thermonuclear fusion — could be reproduced in a controlled laboratory.

The Standard Solar Model has never been directly proven and requires patching for missing neutrinos, coronal heating, and the faint young Sun paradox. The competing **Electric Sun model** — a 250-year tradition from Franklin through Birkeland, Alfvén, and **Wal Thornhill** — proposes the Sun is an anode in a galactic-scale electrical circuit.

SAFIRE's results: the plasma exhibited a stable, continuous **rhythm like a heartbeat** — spontaneous self-organization alien to the Standard Solar Model. The plasma self-organized into rotating double-layer spheres matching observed solar structures. The anode demonstrated **transmutation of elements** — new elements detected via mass spectroscopy — consistent with cold plasma fusion. No radioactive byproducts. Most critically: **the reactor was outputting more energy than it consumed** — reproducibly. Output scaled with plasma configuration rather than power input, suggesting the plasma draws on an external energy source consistent with galactic-scale current delivery. **Aureon Energy Ltd.** was incorporated to commercialize the technology.

## Peter Mungo Jupp: Electric Fossilization

Australian archaeologist **Peter Mungo Jupp** has demonstrated that fossils were created instantaneously by catastrophic electrical discharge — not by 10,000+ years of slow mineral replacement (which is physically impossible since organic tissue decomposes within years).

The proof came from **Alberta, Canada**: a high-voltage transmission wire break brought live current into contact with tree roots, converting them from wet wood to **pure silica in hours**. The chemical pathway: water (H₂O, proton count 10) under massive current can transmute to calcium (proton count 20). Russian studies confirm neutrons propagate during electrical storms, providing a plausible pathway for transmutation of water to calcium carbonate — explaining marine creatures found inside solid limestone.

The fossil record demands instantaneous causation: a plesiosaur petrified mid-birth; jellyfish caught mid-cellular division; ammonites preserved with every detail; mammoths, bears, and camels fused into a calcium carbonate bolus 125 feet across (Hot Springs, South Dakota).

Nuclear physicist **Rick Firestone** (Berkeley) surveyed the **Carolina Bays** — tens of thousands of elliptical depressions across the eastern U.S. with no debris field or crater depth. Inside: nano-diamonds, iridium, helium-3, fullerenes, hollow spherules — a fingerprint identical to bench-scale **plasmoid experiments**. The Bays were formed by plasmoids, not meteor impacts.

## Why This Is Suppressed

An over-unity plasma reactor makes redundant the entire fossil fuel and nuclear energy infrastructure. If electric fossilization is correct, the Scaligerian geological timescale collapses: the fossil record was formed within living memory. Suppression requires only not funding, not publishing, and not including findings in curricula. SAFIRE moved to commercialization because the academic pathway was closed.
