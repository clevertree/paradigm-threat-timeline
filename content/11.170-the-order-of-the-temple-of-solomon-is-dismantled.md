# The Order of the Temple of Solomon is dismantled

> The Order of the Temple of Solomon is dismantled ( in 1307 = 1492 = 1677), after its appropriation by the King of
> France and Navarre, and the colonial enterprise is devised from Italy, in the name of a Holy Roman Empire (twinned),
> which competes with French aspirations. In its place, the Order of Saint John ( in 1312 = 1497 = 1682) is created, in
> which the Prester John is camouflaged under the character of the Baptist, who blesses Christ as the Messiah.
