# Ecliptic pathway of the Absu last seen.

The [Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php) was Saturn's primordial plasma sheath — a system of equatorial ring-layers that enveloped Earth and the inner planets during the Golden Age. To ancient observers it appeared as a luminous ocean standing up from the southern horizon, described as *the Firmament*, the *Duat*, the *House of Nine Bushes*, and the *Abyss* by cultures worldwide. After the catastrophic restructuring of the solar system in 2349 BC (Noah's Flood), when the polar configuration collapsed, the inner Absu fell — but not all of it. A final outer ring persisted, and its slow dispersal over the following millennia left an unmistakable trace in the historical and artistic record.

## The Last Ring: The Uoroboros

After the main Absu collapsed in 2349 BC, one outer ring remained. It was red. This surviving ring sat at approximately 6,000 miles (9,600 km) above the Earth's equator, and because the Earth cast a shadow on it, it appeared each night as a great glowing snake whose head rose in the east, slid across the southern sky, and folded back on its own tail — giving rise to the ancient symbol of the *Uoroboros* (the serpent swallowing its own tail). The Egyptians called it *Apep*, the Greeks *Apophis*, the Hindus *Vritra* or *Ahi*, the Babylonians *Tiamat*, and the Australians the *Rainbow Serpent*. It was the same red equatorial ring, observed from every inhabited continent.

Jno Cook of [SaturnianCosmology.org](https://saturniancosmology.org/noah.php) describes it:

> *"This last outer ring of the Absu lasted a long time, well into the current era. This last equatorial ring has entered mythologies worldwide as a celestial snake — called Apep by the Egyptians and Apophis by the Greeks."*

The ecliptic crossed this red ring at the equinoxes, and their intersection — a giant "X" in the sky — gave rise to the Maya *Saint Andrew's Cross* hieroglyph, used to represent the sky band. Where the ecliptic behind the former Absu had been invisible, it was now exposed for the first time, forming a luminous pathway in the night sky alongside the red equatorial band.

By **AD 600–800**, the red ring of the Uoroboros had faded from direct visibility. By **ca AD 900**, it had disappeared entirely from the sky record.

## Absu Dust: 4,000 Years of Falling Particles

Even after the rings formally dissolved, their dispersal was not instantaneous. The remnant material — dust and micron-scale particles carrying an electric charge from the upper atmosphere — continued to rain down on the Earth's surface for thousands of years. Charles Raspil, in his article *"Spatters and Planetary Iconography"* (The Velikovskian, 1994), documented the artistic record of this ongoing fall:

> *"In their portrayal of the spatter, artists distribute it randomly within the confines of any particular artwork. It is small, taking up little space within the borders of any particular opus, and is multiple, appearing in pluralities. Its random distribution and appearance, along with its nonuniform configuration, suggest that it is a natural phenomenon and not an artistic symbol."*

The characteristic *spatter* — a central ringlet surrounded typically by eight smaller ringlets, or small diamond/square-shaped configurations — appears in the artwork of every continent from the mid-second millennium BC through the **18th century AD**. Raspil traces them across Rhodian plates depicting the Trojan War, ancient Near Eastern reliefs, Egyptian papyri, Mesoamerican codices, and European Renaissance panel paintings. They appear as background texture, cut off by borders, treated as the artist treated clouds or ambient light — not symbols, but objects actually seen.

Jno Cook's interpretation is that on approaching the Earth's surface, the electrostatically charged particles would discharge briefly in arc or glow mode — *"igniting briefly in the blaze of plasma... as suddenly as firecrackers and perhaps with an explosive sound."* Seen from below they would flare, scatter, and vanish.

> *"This would suggest that dust from the Absu rained down for nearly 4,000 years."* — Jno Cook, [SaturnianCosmology.org](https://saturniancosmology.org/noah.php)

## The Final Dispersal: ca AD 1600–1700

Jno Cook's chronological timeline records two reference points for the end of this descent:

- **ca AD 1600** — *"Last of the falling Absu sprinkles"* ([long.php](https://saturniancosmology.org/long.php))
- **AD 1700** — *"Last sprinkling of Absu dust"* ([nevada.php](https://saturniancosmology.org/nevada.php))

The variation in dating (1600 vs. 1700) likely reflects the gradual rather than abrupt end of the process — the final centuries were a thinning-out, not a hard stop. By the early 18th century, the last electrically-charged Absu particles had reached ground level. The sky was, for the first time in recorded human history, fully clear of all remnant Saturn-system material.

## The Ecliptic Pathway: Last Seen AD 1840

One atmospheric trace outlasted even the dust. The **ecliptic pathway** — the luminous band of zodiacal material strewn along the orbital plane by Jupiter's plasma bolts in the asteroid belt — remained faintly visible for another century after the dust fell silent.

Jno Cook from SaturnianCosmology.org [describes the pathway](https://saturniancosmology.org/flood.php#flood-g34):

> *"The destruction wrought by Jupiter with plasma bolts in the asteroid belt (Hesiod's second battle) would have left dust and debris strewn along the ecliptic, causing the 'path of the Gods' to be marked like a highway, defining the road of the Sun and the planets — the zodiac. The lighted zodiac (the ecliptic) was last seen from Earth in AD 1840."*

This closing date — **AD 1840** — marks the definitive end of any visible remnant of the Saturnian system. The sequence of terminal events thus reads:
- ca **AD 600–800**: Red Uoroboros ring fades
- ca **AD 900**: Uoroboros fully gone
- ca **AD 1600–1700**: Last Absu dust reaches ground
- **AD 1840**: Ecliptic zodiacal pathway last observed

## Connection to the MudFlood Event

The convergence of these terminal dates with the late 18th-century political crisis is striking. The [Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) erupted in 1773 — within a century of the last confirmed Absu dust fall and within decades of the final ecliptic fading. The Absu's long dispersal had maintained a persistent electrical connection between Earth's upper atmosphere and the remnant Saturn-system material. As the last of this charged material cleared, the atmospheric electrical equilibrium that had prevailed throughout antiquity was finally broken.

The [MudFlood Energetic Event](./12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md) (discussed in full elsewhere) describes a catastrophic electric discharge event in the late 18th century that buried entire cities worldwide and eliminated the remaining populations loyal to the Rus-Tartarian empire. The atmospheric conditions — the loss of the long-standing Absu charge envelope — may have made Earth's upper atmosphere newly receptive to directed energy weapons or to spontaneous large-scale discharge events of a kind that could not have occurred while the protective Absu layer, however diminished, was still present.

The Absu's 4,000-year farewell ended quietly with electrically popping motes of dust visible to 17th-century Dutch and Spanish artists as background spatters in their paintings. What followed, within a few generations, was anything but quiet.
