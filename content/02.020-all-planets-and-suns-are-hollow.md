# All planets and suns are hollow

The reason for the Absu having multiple layers, as depicted on ancient artifacts, is described in the theory of
[Electromagnetism](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnets.html).
In this theory, any object with energy passing through/around it will
[polarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizability),
causing the lines of magnetic flux to appear in layers of different charge. At high amplitude, matter sticks to each
layer eventually forming concentric circles within the body to increasingly capacitate that energy. As a result,
charging a space body (like a planet) with additional energy will cause it to grow in size. As a planet grows in size,
the gap between the inner circles expands, causing the planet to become [hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfFJiUWuDk).

*From anywhere on the northern hemisphere of the Earth, one could look northwards and see in order: Mars, Venus, then the gas giant Saturn. Behind Saturn was the gas giant Jupiter, which was not yet visible. Behind Jupiter, at a 26.7 degree angle, was our Sun. All together, they form an unmistakable Star and crescent in the sky worshiped throughout the Persian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, and throughout Islam today. This deity was known in Egypt as Osiris the *Triform God*, and as *The Trinity* in Babylonian and Abrahamic religion.*
