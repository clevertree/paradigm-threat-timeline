# The naming of Christ

Christ means “anointed one” -meaning he was anointed with oil as part of ancient Deep State ritual
of [Baptism](https://redeeminggod.com/egyptian-baptism/). This was unique for only one reason - Christ and his mother
were [large hairy humans](http://en.posztukiwania.pl/2014/07/19/hairy-mary/) from the eastern lands of Siberia -
a land of giants that rarely participated in any Deep State religious ceremonies. This land would birth the first
world empire since the dark ages and would come to be known as the Kingdom of Tartaria.

The Latin Bible contains a *western* perspective of the Crucifixion, a story originally written in the Cyrillic bible,
but many of the facts are the same. The story of Christ begins with
the [census](https://www.christianity.com/jesus/birth-of-jesus/bethlehem/was-there-really-a-census-at-the-time-of-jesuss-birth.html)
ordered by the religious leaders of Jerusalem in Istanbul. However, it is illogical to suggest that a pregnant woman
(who is due) would be forced to travel to take part in a census. That *never happens* in any census. Instead, the
census was of a very different nature; the Deep State was counting the giants of the region in preparation for a
*planned genocide* of giants.
