# Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm

The following researchers argue that ancient myth, scripture, sacred art, geology, and archaeology are not allegory, psychology, or metaphor — they are eyewitness records of real planetary events, cosmic disasters, and catastrophic sky configurations experienced by human populations within the last 12,000 years.

This article also includes researchers who challenge mainstream dating AND interpret ancient sources as cataclysm ("does both"). Their chronological work is summarized in [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](00.01.04-authors-challenging-chronology.md).

## The Core Saturnian Network

These researchers form the interconnected scholarly network that directly underlies the cosmological claims in this timeline's earliest chapters.

### Wal Thornhill
Physicist and co-founder of the Thunderbolts Project. Thornhill developed the Electric Universe model, providing the plasma physics mechanism for how the Saturnian polar configuration was physically possible — how Saturn could have appeared as a near-stationary "sun" in Earth's polar sky, how the configuration was powered, and how its catastrophic breakup produced the mythological record.

### Ralph Juergens (1924–1979)
The originator of the Electric Sun hypothesis — the proposal that the Sun is powered by an external galactic electric current rather than internal thermonuclear fusion. Juergens's model is the physical foundation for understanding how close planetary approaches could exchange electrical charges, how Venus could be a recently formed plasma body, and how the electrical scarring on Mars and the Moon was produced.

### David Talbott
The primary architect of the Saturn Myth reconstruction. From worldwide comparative mythology, Talbott established that Saturn, Venus, and Mars were arrayed along Earth's polar axis in a Golden Age configuration, visible as a fixed "Wheel of Heaven" — and that global myths record the same configuration and the same catastrophic dispersal.

### Dwardu Cardona (1937–2018)
Extended Talbott's reconstruction backward into the pre-configuration "God Star" era — the period when Saturn was a lone protosun before the inner solar system was organized into its current (or recent) configuration.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.11.00-dwardu-cardona.md)

### Jno Cook
Author of the most detailed Saturnian chronology. Cook synthesized the entire Talbott-Thornhill-Cardona-Cochrane framework and applied cross-cultural calendar triangulation (Mesoamerican Long Count, Chinese annals, Mesopotamian king lists) to produce specific calendar dates for each event. The dates in this timeline's opening chapters come primarily from Cook.

## Foundation Texts

### Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend
*Hamlet's Mill* (1969) established the methodological basis for the entire project: that ancient myth reliably encodes precise astronomical observation. Without this foundation, the mythological evidence underlying the polar configuration could be dismissed as folklore.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.08.00-de-santillana-von-dechend.md)

### Immanuel Velikovsky (1895–1979)
The pioneer. Velikovsky established that Venus was a recently displaced comet, that the plagues of Exodus recorded a near-miss planetary catastrophe, and that ancient myth is not allegory. His institutional suppression (documented by de Grazia and Ginenthal) established the template that every catastrophist after him had to navigate.

## Physical Science

### Anthony Peratt
Plasma physicist (Los Alamos) who demonstrated that ancient petroglyphs worldwide map precisely to laboratory high-current Z-pinch plasma discharge forms. Established the physical reality of the polar plasma configuration from the archaeological record.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.07.00-anthony-peratt.md)

### Donald Scott
Engineering-grade formalization of the EU model. Translated Juergens's electric sun into mathematically precise plasma engineering terms, making the EU model testable and accessible.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.13.00-donald-scott.md)

### Martinus van der Sluijs
Extended Peratt's petroglyph plasma work into ancient written texts, documenting the world column, cosmic axis, and pillar of heaven across Mesopotamian, Indian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican literary sources.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.20.00-martinus-van-der-sluijs.md)

## Mythological Analysis

### Ev Cochrane
Applied comparative mythology to Mars and Venus specifically. Established the cross-cultural "multi-armed hairy warrior goddess" as Venus visible at plasma-discharge close approach, and the "cosmic warrior dragon-slayer" as Mars in the same context.

## Astronomical & Metrological

### Livio Stecchini (1913–1979)
Demonstrated that Babylonian Venus records encode orbital periods inconsistent with Venus's current orbit — direct physical corroboration of Velikovsky's displaced-orbit claim — and that ancient measurement systems encode geodetic knowledge far beyond what conventional chronology assigns to those cultures.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.16.00-livio-stecchini.md)

### Lynn Rose & Raymond Vaughan
Mathematical derivation of the **685 BCE Venus orbital stabilization date** from the Venus Tablets of Ammizaduga. This date is the primary anchor for the close of this timeline's Dark Ages chapter.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.17.00-rose-vaughan.md)

### Tom Van Flandern (1940–2009)
The Exploded Planet Hypothesis — the asteroid belt is the debris of a former full-sized planet, and Mars is its former moon. Provides the astronomical-physical context for Mars's anomalous surface features and its role in the Saturnian catastrophe sequence.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.19.00-tom-van-flandern.md)

## Catastrophism from Within Mainstream Science

### Victor Clube & Bill Napier
Oxford and Armagh Observatory astronomers who argued — using standard astronomical methods — that the Taurid meteor complex is the fragmented remnant of a giant comet, and that historical civilizations were catastrophically bombarded by it during the Bronze Age Collapse and early medieval period.

## Systematizers & Defenders

### Alfred de Grazia (1919–2014)
Coined "quantavolution"; produced the 15-volume Quantavolution & Catastrophe series systematizing all catastrophist research. Also documented Velikovsky's suppression in *The Velikovsky Affair* and *Cosmic Heretics*.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.15.00-alfred-de-grazia.md)

### Charles Ginenthal
Point-by-point rebuttal of Sagan's 1974 AAAS takedown of Velikovsky. The definitive published response to the institutional suppression.

## Does Both: Challenge Chronology AND Interpret Cataclysm

The following researchers appear here because their work interpreting catastrophe is inseparable from their chronological revision. See also [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](00.01.04-authors-challenging-chronology.md) for the pure-chronology perspective.

### Anatoly Fomenko (b. 1945)
Mathematical proof that Scaligerian chronology is a fabrication — AND the framework placing the historical Christ in 12th-century Constantinople, identifying the Mongol Empire with the Russian-Horde, and reading medieval chronicles as the real content behind "ancient" texts.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.05.00-anatoly-fomenko.md)

### Gunnar Heinsohn (b. 1943)
Stratigraphic proof that the 1st millennium BCE "ghost empires" do not have distinct physical layers — AND the identification of a catastrophic event around 930–940 CE that erased the Roman world.

### Robert Schoch (b. 1959)
Geological re-dating of the Sphinx to 7,000–10,000 BCE — AND the solar plasma outburst hypothesis that a massive coronal event around 9,700 BCE destroyed an earlier civilization and ended the ice age.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.22.00-robert-schoch.md)

### Graham Hancock (b. 1950)
Argues for an advanced civilization destroyed by the Younger Dryas impact event (~10,900 BCE) — AND interprets Plato's Atlantis, global flood myths, and ancient monument alignments as literal records of this civilization and its destruction.

**Full profile:** [→ Full Article](15.23.00-graham-hancock.md)

### Michael Cremo (b. 1948)
Documented suppressed evidence for multi-million-year human antiquity — AND interprets Vedic literature as literal cosmic history describing cyclical civilizations stretching back hundreds of millions of years.
