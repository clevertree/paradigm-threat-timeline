# Napoleon invades Russia

[Main article: The MudFlood and World Cataclysm](11.270-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md)

Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 — the [Grande Armée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e)'s catastrophic six-month campaign across the same territories that had been Moscow Tartary just forty years earlier — is one of the most consequential military events in European history. The conventional narrative presents it as Napoleon's fatal overreach: an army of 680,000 that entered Russia and returned as fewer than 100,000 survivors.

## Why Moscow?

The invasion's strategic objective was to force Czar Alexander I into negotiations by seizing the old symbolic capital. But Moscow in 1812 was no longer the center it had been. The Romanovs had relocated to St. Petersburg; Moscow was an administrative backwater. When Alexander refused to negotiate and the Russians burned Moscow themselves rather than let it serve as a French winter headquarters, Napoleon had no strategic objective to achieve. He occupied charred ruins for five weeks and then retreated into the Russian winter.

In the NC framework, this sequence has an additional dimension. The territories of former Moscow Tartary — Siberia, the Urals, the far east — had been incorporated into Romanov Russia only since the late 18th century. Local loyalty to the Romanov state in these regions was thin. A French-style liberation campaign promising feudal abolition (Napoleon had abolished serfdom in Poland and other territories he controlled) might have found substantial sympathies among the recently-conquered Hordian populations of the east. The Romanov court was not unaware of this possibility — which explains the ferocity of the scorched-earth response, designed to ensure Napoleon found no resources and no allies in the interior.

## The Battle of Borodino and Its Aftermath

The [Battle of Borodino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Borodino) (7 September 1812) was the largest single day's battle in the Napoleonic Wars — 70,000 casualties in a single day. Neither side achieved a decisive outcome. The Russian army retreated but maintained cohesion. Napoleon occupied Moscow two weeks later. The subsequent French retreat became one of history's most devastating military disasters: cold, starvation, partisan attacks, and river crossings destroyed the army as an effective force.

## Napoleon and the Hordian Legacy

Tchaikovsky's [1812 Overture](11.310-tchaikovsky-releases-1812-overture.md), composed in 1880, celebrates the Russian victory over Napoleon. It opens with the Russian Orthodox hymn *God Preserve Thy People* (associated with the old Kievan/Hordian church tradition), transitions through French and Russian military themes, and culminates in the *Solemn March* with cannon fire and church bells. The NC reading of the overture sees in it the last musical celebration of the Hordian legacy: the Orthodox church bells, the Old Russian hymns, and the cannon fire all belong to the cultural sphere that the Romanovs had been systematically erasing since 1613 — temporarily recovered in the national trauma of 1812.

Napoleon's defeat did not restore the old order; it accelerated the financial one. With Napoleon gone, the Romanovs were securely the dominant land power of the Eurasian heartland, and the City of London was the dominant financial power. The stage was set for the 19th century's consolidation of the British Empire and the railroad-and-debt penetration of every remaining independent territory.
