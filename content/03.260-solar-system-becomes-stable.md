# Solar System becomes stable

By 670 B.C.E., the Earth's orbit became circular and the period of *creation* that formed the planets of our Solar
System comes to an end. Earth's new orbit and season schedule would be pleasantly predictable. In religious text, the
*one* God (our Sun) *drives out the many* (other planets) to rule over a new age. Once again, Deep State Monotheism
would lose ground with the general populations as no priest could have predicted this event. Free of their control, the
general population formed [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Persian_origins_or_influences) around the
concept of **knowing** - in contrast with the *encrypted secrecy* of Deep State religions. The gnostic evangelists would
be known for spreading the [Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gospel) meaning **"good news"**. What was the good
news? The new Sun God was of a very different nature from the old Creator God Saturn. The Sun provides endless abundance
without asking for anything in return. The Sun reveals dark places and old secrets. The Sun would never die. The
good news was that from now on - the world would remain free - as nobody could claim the authority of the Sun!
