# The Great Comet of 1664 / 1665

Either by coincidence (or more likely by some design of Deep State engineers), a series of phenomenal comets approached
Earth prior to the apocalyptic date in shorter intervals and longer progressions. The largest and longest
lasting [comet](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxxvii/)
of the series was seen between 1664(C / 1664 W1) and 1665(C / 1665 F1) which lasted over 80 days.
