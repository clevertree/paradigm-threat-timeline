# Hundred Years' War ends — Fall of Czar-Grad (1453 CE)

## The War's Context

The [Hundred Years' War began in the 14th century](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.00.00-1300-ce-14th-century-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slavic-horde.md) as coordinated Western European resistance against the Horde's conquest — Deep State-orchestrated rebellion exploiting the [religious schism](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.01.00-european-religious-schism-emerges.md) to rally vassal populations against imperial rule. The conventional Scaligerian framing (England vs. France, 1337–1453) masks what the New Chronology identifies as a much larger conflict: the continued military subjugation of Western Europe by the armies of Russia-Horde and its Ottoman (Ataman) successor.

## Star Metal — The Decisive Weapon

In 1421, a [large iron meteorite fell near Yaroslavl](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.01.00-1421-ce-meteorite-falls-on-yaroslavl.md), the true Veliky Novgorod and capital of Russia-Horde. The Horde's master craftsmen discovered that the meteorite debris, when used as a smelting additive, produced extraordinarily strong steel — the famous **Damask (Bulat) steel** ([chronologia.org Ch. 5 §32](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_30.html)):

> *"There was enough of the valuable meteor iron to organize in the XV century the manufacturing of a significant amount of the Damask steel for the army of Russia-Horde. This, partially, explains the military superiority of the Cossack armies of that time. The Damask steel Russian (aka 'Indian') blades cut through the shields, armour and swords of their enemies."*

Damask swords shattered ordinary shields and armour, the composition could not be replicated without the meteorite, and the weapons' celestial origin was weaponized as proof of divine favour. Combined with existing artillery superiority, the Horde became unstoppable in both ranged and close combat.

The name "Damascus steel" is a corruption: *D-Mascus* = the kingdom of Mosokh = **Moscow**, not the Syrian city. "Indian steel" and "Syrian steel" likewise referred to Russia-Horde. After the Empire's 17th-century breakup, splinter states found leftover Damask weapons and celebrated "their own" ancient steel traditions, forgetting the common Yaroslavl origin.

## Joan of Arc = The Biblical Deborah

Fomenko identifies Joan of Arc as the Old Testament prophetess **Deborah** from the Book of Judges ([chronologia.org Ch. 6 §30](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_30.html)). Even mainstream historians admit Joan was not called "Joan of Arc" until the late 16th century. The Biblical description of Deborah's campaigns references the **Assyrians** (= Russians), kings of **Canaan** (= Khan rulers), the town of **Kedesh** (= Czar-Grad), and the waters of **Megiddi** (= Macedonia). Her comrade Gilles de Rais is identified as the Biblical **Samson**. Joan/Deborah's execution by the Inquisition was one of many cases of the Empire's own enforcement apparatus suppressing western provincial rebellion.

## The Fall of Czar-Grad (1453)

In **1453**, Sultan Mehmed II besieged and took Czar-Grad (Constantinople). The Bible describes this as the conquest of **Jericho** by Joshua Ben Nun's army ([chronologia.org Ch. 5 §15](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_15.html)):

> *"The 'jubilee trumpets' are simply the cannons. And a 'loud sound' is simply the cannonade. The walls were destroyed by the heavy siege cannons."*

Constantinople's legendary triple walls were reduced to rubble by Horde siege artillery. The fall demonstrates the full convergence of Horde military technologies: cannons to break walls, Damask-armed infantry to storm breaches, Cossack cavalry to rout defenders.

## Aftermath — The Deep State Pivots

The Western Deep State, forced to acknowledge that direct military resistance was futile, drew a crucial lesson: **they could not defeat the Horde by force.** The only option was subversion from within — infiltrating the Empire ideologically, religiously, and politically. This strategic pivot manifested as the [adoption of Latin](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.00-language-of-the-deep-state.md) as a counter-religious vehicle, the creation of [Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md), and eventually the [Apocalypse Crusade of 1492](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.06.00-1492-ce-the-apocalypse-crusade.md).

## Star Metal in Modern Media

The archetype of a heaven-sent metal granting invincible weapons has been laundered into modern entertainment: **Conan Exiles** features "Star Metal" harvested from meteorites; **Skyrim** has Meteoric Iron and Ebony; **The Witcher** uses Meteorite Silver for monster-slaying swords; **Game of Thrones** features the sword *Dawn*, forged from a fallen star. In every case: a rare celestial metal, finite in supply, producing weapons no ordinary forge can match. This is the actual history of the Yaroslavl meteorite repackaged as fantasy lore.
