# Hundred Years' War ends — Fall of Czar-Grad (1453 CE)

## The War's Context

The [Hundred Years' War began in the 14th century](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.00.00-1300-ce-14th-century-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slavic-horde.md) as coordinated Western European resistance against the Horde's conquest — Deep State-orchestrated pockets of rebellion that exploited the [religious schism](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.01.00-european-religious-schism-emerges.md) to rally vassal populations against imperial rule. The conventional Scaligerian framing (England vs. France, 1337–1453) masks what the New Chronology identifies as a much larger conflict: the continued military subjugation of Western Europe by the armies of Russia-Horde and its Ottoman (Ataman) successor.

By the early 15th century the Empire's war machine had been grinding against entrenched Western resistance for generations. The Horde possessed superior cavalry raised in the vast Russian steppes and had pioneered industrial iron and gunpowder production since the early 14th century, giving them cannons and muskets that most opponents lacked. But the sheer geographic scale of Western Europe — its fortified cities, its mountain passes, its seaboard kingdoms — meant the conquest stalled in a long attritional struggle. That all changed in **1421**.

## Star Metal — The Decisive Weapon

In 1421, a [large iron meteorite fell near Yaroslavl](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.01.00-1421-ce-meteorite-falls-on-yaroslavl.md) (the true Veliky Novgorod and capital of Russia-Horde), an event recorded in Russian chronicles as rocks falling from the sky out of a fiery cloud. The Horde master craftsmen soon discovered that the meteorite debris, when used as an additive in the smelting process, produced an extraordinarily strong and resilient steel — the famous **Damask (Bulat) steel** ([chronologia.org Ch. 5 §32](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_30.html)).

Fomenko and Nosovskiy explain:

> *"There was enough of the valuable meteor iron to organize in the XV century the manufacturing of a significant amount of the Damask steel for the army of Russia-Horde. This, partially, explains the military superiority of the Cossack armies of that time. The Damask steel Russian (aka 'Indian') blades cut through the shields, armour and swords of their enemies."* — [How It Was In Reality, Ch. 5 §32](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_30.html)

The implications were devastating for any force opposing the Horde:

- **Damask steel swords sliced through ordinary metal weapons, shields, and armour with ease.** Soldiers clad in chain armour and wielding Bulat blades had an insurmountable advantage on any battlefield.
- **The secret could not be replicated.** The composition of the meteorite was unknown even to the smiths — they only knew that the debris worked as an additive. Without understanding the chemistry, no enemy could reproduce the steel. The "secret" was lost the moment the finite meteorite supply ran out.
- **Psychological warfare.** To opposing armies, weapons that shattered their best shields and armour seemed *divine*. The metal was literally from the heavens. The Horde encouraged this perception — remnants of the meteorite were carried in holy arcs (the Biblical Ark of the Covenant; the Kaaba) to signal God's favor.
- **Combined with existing artillery superiority**, the Damask-armed Horde was now effectively unstoppable in close combat *and* at range. The Ottomans-Atamans were already "largely victorious in Europe due to their more powerful artillery" ([chronologia.org Ch. 6 §19](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_19.html)). Damask steel closed the gap in melee engagements as well.

The name "Damascus steel" itself is a corruption: *D-Mascus* = the kingdom of Mosokh = **Moscovia**, not the Syrian city. Similarly, "Indian steel" and "Syrian steel" referred to Russia-Horde (which was called "India" and "Syria" in the chronicles of that era). After the Empire's breakup in the 17th century, splinter states found leftover Damask weapons in their arsenals and began celebrating "their own" ancient steel traditions, forgetting that all these names pointed back to the same Yaroslavl origin.

## Joan of Arc = The Biblical Deborah

The conventional narrative places Joan of Arc (c. 1412–1431) as the turning point of the war — a peasant girl who rallied France against England. According to Fomenko, she is the same figure as the Old Testament prophetess and warrior **Deborah** from the Book of Judges ([chronologia.org Ch. 6 §30](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_30.html)). Even mainstream historians admit that Joan was not called "Joan of Arc" until the second half of the 16th century — meaning she was known by a different name for over a century. That name, according to the New Chronology, was Deborah.

The Biblical description of Deborah's campaigns references the **Assyrians** (= Russians), the kings of **Canaan** (= Khan rulers), the town of **Kedesh** (= Czar-Grad), and the waters of **Megiddi** (= Macedonia). What the Scaligerian version compressed into a regional French conflict, the Old Testament remembers as large-scale warfare across the Ottoman-Horde Empire.

Her comrade-in-arms, the French Marshal **Gilles de Rais**, is identified in the same framework as the Biblical **Samson** — a generalized allegorical figure for the Zemshchina resistance forces.

Joan/Deborah's execution by the Inquisition was one of many incidents in which the Empire's own enforcement apparatus — the "Judges of Israel" = **the Inquisition of the XV–XVI centuries** — attempted to suppress rebellion in the western provinces.

## The Fall of Czar-Grad (1453)

The war ended not through negotiation, but through overwhelming force. In **1453**, Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror besieged and took Czar-Grad (Constantinople), the seat of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Bible describes this event as the conquest of **Jericho** by Joshua Ben Nun's army ([chronologia.org Ch. 5 §15](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_15.html)):

> *"The 'jubilee trumpets' are simply the cannons. And a 'loud sound' is simply the cannonade. The walls were destroyed by the heavy siege cannons."*

The triple belt of Constantinople's legendary walls — considered a miracle of fortification — was reduced to rubble by the Horde's heavy siege artillery. Ayyub Sultan, the companion and standard-bearer of Prophet Muhammad (who the New Chronology identifies as a contemporary of Mehmed II, not a figure from 800 years earlier), fell at the walls that night.

The stability of the Empire throughout this period rested on "the extreme military superiority of the Horde which established in the XIV century" ([chronologia.org Ch. 9](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/09.html)). In addition to industrial-scale iron and gunpowder production, Cossack cavalry, and heavy artillery, the Empire now wielded Damask steel blades that cut through anything their enemies could field. The fall of Czar-Grad demonstrates the full convergence of these technologies: cannons to break walls, Damask-armed infantry to storm breaches, mounted Cossacks to rout fleeing defenders.

## Aftermath — The Deep State Pivots

The conventional "Hundred Years' War" (1337–1453) terminates on this same date — the fall of Czar-Grad. The Western European Deep State, now forced to acknowledge that direct military resistance to the Empire was futile, drew a crucial lesson: **they could not defeat the Horde by force.**

The Damask steel would eventually run out (the meteorite debris was finite), and firearms would gradually diminish the importance of melee weaponry. But in 1453, the Deep State could not know that. What they saw was an enemy that wielded divinely-gifted metal, unbreakable blades, siege cannons that shattered any wall, and an inexhaustible supply of steppe cavalry. Direct confrontation was suicide.

The only remaining option was **subversion from within** — infiltrating the Rus-Horde Empire ideologically, religiously, and politically rather than meeting it on the battlefield. This strategic pivot would manifest as the [Deep State's adoption of Latin](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.00-language-of-the-deep-state.md) as a vehicle for a counter-religion, the creation of [Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md), and eventually the [Reverse Exodus of 1492](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.06.00-1492-ce-apocalypse-crusade-reverse-exodus.md) — flipping the script to *invade* the Empire from within.

## Predictive Programming — "Star Metal" in Modern Media

The story of a heaven-sent metal that grants its wielder invincible weapons — too powerful for any conventional force to oppose — has been laundered into modern entertainment as *fantasy lore*, severed from its historical origin. Audiences absorb the core narrative (a rare meteoritic ore, forged into unbreakable blades that cut through ordinary steel) without ever connecting it to the Yaroslavl meteorite of 1421 and the Damask steel that gave the Horde its decisive edge.

### Video Games

- **Conan Exiles** — Explicitly features "Star Metal" as a rare resource harvested from meteorites that crash into the game world. It is used to forge the highest-tier weapons and armour, directly echoing the Yaroslavl meteorite-to-Bulat-steel pipeline. The earlier [Conan the Adventurer animated series](https://conananimated.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Metal) built its entire premise around star metal weapons that could defeat an otherwise invincible supernatural enemy.
- **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** — Features multiple "otherworldly metals": Ebony (described as the crystallized blood of a dead god), Stalhrim (enchanted ice-metal), and Meteoric Iron. All share the archetype of a divine or celestial material that produces weapons superior to anything mundane smiths can forge.
- **The Witcher Series** (Books / Games / TV) — Meteorite Silver is a crafting material used to forge special high-end swords. The Witcher's silver blade — designed to kill monsters that resist normal steel — mirrors the Damask blade's ability to cut through defenses that ordinary weapons could not penetrate.
- **Dragon Age** — Meteorite Ore appears as a rare resource used to craft uniquely powerful items, reinforcing the same pattern: metal from the sky = supreme weapons.

### Literature and Film

- **Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire** — The sword *Dawn*, wielded by Ser Arthur Dayne, is forged from the metal of a fallen star and described as pale as milkglass. It is presented as one of the most formidable weapons in the entire setting — a singular blade whose origin material cannot be replicated.
- **Lord of the Rings** — While not explicitly called "star metal," *mithril* and the special elven blades (Andúril, reforged from the shards of Narsil) carry the same mythic weight: an otherworldly material, finite in supply, that produces weapons no ordinary forge can match. Mithril is mined from a single, exhaustible vein — much like the finite Yaroslavl meteorite debris.
- **The Northman** (2022) — Features a supernatural sword that can only be drawn under specific ritual conditions, echoing the sacred treatment of Damask-forged weapons that were enshrouded in legend and religious mystique.

### Music and Comics

- **Doom / Stoner Metal** — Bands like Electric Wizard (notably the track "Barbarian") and Eternal Champion build entire albums around sword-and-sorcery imagery directly descended from the Conan mythos, keeping the "star metal" archetype alive in sonic form.
- **Conan Comics** (Marvel, Dark Horse, Titan) — Have continuously published Conan the Barbarian since the 1970s, maintaining the original dark tone of the lore in which star metal weapons define the balance of power between civilizations.

The pattern is consistent: a celestial metal of finite supply, forged into weapons that no conventional material can withstand, conferring military supremacy on whoever possesses it — and once exhausted, its secret is lost forever. This is not a fantasy trope invented by fiction writers. It is the actual history of the Yaroslavl meteorite, the Damask steel of Russia-Horde, and the military conquest that ended the Hundred Years' War — repackaged as entertainment so that no one thinks to look for its real-world source.
