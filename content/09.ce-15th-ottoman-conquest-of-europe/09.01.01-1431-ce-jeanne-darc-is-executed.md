# Jeanne d'Arc is executed in Rouen, France

Scaligerian dating places Joan of Arc at ~1412–1431 CE. She led French forces against the English, freed Orléans from siege in 1429, was captured by the Burgundians, tried by the Inquisition for "insubordination and heterodoxy," and burnt at the stake in Rouen. In Fomenko and Nosovskiy's reconstruction, **this date is displaced ~150 years backward** — placing her in the XVI century (~1580 CE), within the broader Ottoman conquest and Horde Inquisition.

## Joan of Arc = the Biblical Prophetess Deborah

*The Maid of Orléans began to be called **Joan of Arc** only from the second half of the XVI century — implying she was called something else for over a century. According to Fomenko, she was called **Deborah**, under which name she entered the Old Testament (Judges 4–5). The "biblical events" were pushed ~2,600 years into the past, and later historians perceived Joan and Deborah as entirely different characters.*

The comparison reveals vivid parallelism first noted by XVII–XVIII century chroniclers, later reclassified as "literary comparison." The original texts actually **directly identified** the two figures.

## Empire-Wide Campaigns, Squeezed into France

In Fomenko's reconstruction, the original geography was vast. The Bible references the **Assyrians** (Judges 4:2) = the Russians; **kings of Canaan** = Khan rulers; town of **Kedesh** (Judges 4:6) = Czar-Grad (Constantinople); waters of **Megiddi** (Judges 5:19) = Macedonia. These empire-wide campaigns were artificially compressed into a single French county — distant names relocated, the entire story converted into a "purely French" affair. This compression is a hallmark of XVII–XVIII century chronological falsification.

## The Epoch of the Judges = the Epoch of the Inquisition

Three Book of Judges storylines correspond to major Inquisition trials:

1. **Deborah / Joan of Arc** (Judges 4–5): prophetess-warrior found guilty and executed
2. **Abimelech / Simon de Montfort** (Judges 9): led the crusade against Cathars by fire and sword
3. **Samson / Gilles de Rais** (Judges 13–16): French marshal burnt at the stake in Nantes

## Gilles de Rais = Samson

Joan of Arc's legendary comrade-in-arms, Marshal Gilles de Rais, is the biblical **Samson**. The French version is a secondary reflection — both are ultimately reflections of XVI century events in Russia-Horde: the struggle of **Zemshchina** against **Oprichnina** under Ivan IV. The "Philistines" are the Oprichniki. Delilah's betrayal corresponds to the betrayal of Zemshchina leader Cheliadnin by Prince Vladimir Staritsky. Samson's "fantastical strength" becomes comprehensible when understood as representing the social force of Zemshchina, backed by the Orthodox Church under Metropolitan Philip Kolychev.

The Inquisition emerges not as a uniquely Western Catholic institution, but as an administrative arm of the **'Mongol' Empire** — recorded under French names, Hebrew names, but describing the same Imperial authority.

She was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the Church, declared a witch, and burnt. Nearly 489 years later (1920), the Catholic Church canonized her.
