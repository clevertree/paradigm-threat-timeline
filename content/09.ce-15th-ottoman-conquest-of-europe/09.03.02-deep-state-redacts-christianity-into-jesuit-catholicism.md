# Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism

To control conquered territories, the Deep State needed a "slave" version of monotheism. Converting the Horde and its vassals to a doctrine antithetical to Gnostic Christianity required supplanting Christianity itself into *Catholicism*. Thus the [Secret Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monita_Secreta) was created.

*The Jesuit operation: indigenous solar religion — Christ as the Sun traversing the Zodiac — was overwritten into invisible, Rome-mediated monotheism.*

## Christ as a Solar Allegory: What Was Redacted

The ancient world encoded theology in celestial movements. The story of Christ is, at its core, **an astrological allegory for the Sun's annual passage through the twelve Zodiac houses**. As [solarmythology.com](https://solarmythology.com/) documents, this was known openly in the 19th century before being suppressed: *"There is evidence people were well aware of it... These people were eliminated by the Catholic Church and all books exposing the allegory were burned."*

Key works: Dupuis, *Origin of All Religious Worship* (1798); Volney, *The Ruins* (1791); Rev. Robert Taylor, *The Diegesis* (1829); Stowe, *Bible Astrology* (1907); Acharya S, *The Christ Conspiracy* (1999).

## The Zodiac Ministry

The structural parallels are precise: Sun reborn Dec. 25 (3 days after solstice "death") = Jesus born Dec. 25, resurrected after 3 days; Sun through 12 Zodiac houses = 12 disciples, one-year ministry; Sun in Aquarius = baptism with John; Sun in Pisces = fishermen disciples; Sun in Aries = "Lamb of God"; Crucifixion at Vernal Equinox = Sun *cross*-ing the celestial equator; Resurrection = Sun ascending after spring equinox.

**Bethlehem** = Hebrew *Beth* (house) + *lehem* (bread) = "House of Bread" = **Virgo** (depicted holding grain). Mary = Virgo; Joseph = Saturn; The Magi = Orion's Belt; Star of Bethlehem = Venus.

Scripture confirming Christ = Sun: *"I am the light of the world"* (John 8:12); *"His face shone like the sun"* (Matt 17:2); *"Through him all things were made"* (John 1:3 — without the Sun, nothing grows).

## Mo-Zeus and Je-Zeus: Jupiter Rebranded

Before the redaction, the "Son of God" was **visible every night** as Jupiter. The etymological chain: **Zeus** (Greek) = **Jupiter** (Roman); **Mo-Zeus** → **Moses** (radiant face, lawgiver = Jupiter's kingly function); **Je-Zeus** → **Iesous** → **Jesus** (Greek form embeds Zeus directly).

The old solar religion had two visible Sons: the **Sun** (daily/seasonal deity) and **Jupiter** (lawgiver, judge). Indigenous populations worshipped these as Mithras, Horus, Osiris, Quetzalcoatl, Dionysus, Krishna, Apollo, Baldur — all with solar birth/death/resurrection structure. The Jesuit-Catholic redaction **merged both** into one invisible figure. By making God invisible, the Church became the **sole interpreter** of God's will — old priests pointed to the sky; new priests pointed to a text they alone controlled.

## The Suppression: Forced Conversion

Conversion was **terror**, not persuasion. Indigenous solar religion was **exterminated and replaced**. The methodology: (1) **burning astronomical libraries** — Alexandria, Maya codices (4 survive from thousands), Aztec manuscripts; (2) **conflating indigenous gods with demons** — making continued worship punishable by death; (3) **absorbing solar festivals** — Winter Solstice → Christmas, Ishtar/Ostara → Easter, harvest → All Saints; dates kept, meaning stripped; (4) **theological confiscation** — December 25 was the Roman feast of *Sol Invictus* ("Birthday of the Unconquered Sun") since 274 CE; (5) **silencing witnesses** — Gibbon noted no contemporary chronicler recorded the Jesus story despite the period being "one of the best documented in history" — explained by the events being allegorical.

## What the "Slave Religion" Was

Gnostic Christians understood the cosmic allegory. They recognized multiple divine principles, maintained astronomical knowledge, and understood Christ as a principle (*logos*, light, reason) rather than a literal person. The Jesuit-Catholic redaction **inverted** this: esoteric knowledge was stripped from laity and reserved for clergy; solar cosmology was reframed as "paganism"; seasonal, observable sky worship was replaced with obedience to invisible Rome-mediated authority; resistance = heresy = death.

As Galileo was told in 1632: *"it would be necessary to forbid men to look at the heavens."* That is not a religion seeking truth — it is an information monopoly defending its franchise.
