# The Apocalypse Crusade

## Disease as a Weapon of Authority

The stated justification for the Apocalypse Crusade was the eradication of disease — specifically the **venereal plagues** that had spread across Western Europe through the [bacchanalian cult](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html#the9) that Fomenko identifies as the dominant form of Western Christianity in the XIII–XV centuries. Ceremonial prostitution was an integral part of Western Christian liturgy during this period. Brothels operated openly in major cities, their presence immortalized in the sexual frescoes of [Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii) — which Fomenko dates not to "79 AD" but to the XV–XVI century ([chronologia.org Ch. 5 §9](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html#the9)).

The diseases bred in these brothels — syphilis chief among them — did not stay local. They traveled back to the heart of the Rus-Horde Empire along the **same trade channels the Empire had built**. The Silk Road, the Mediterranean shipping lanes, the overland caravan routes: every artery of imperial commerce became a vector of infection. The Khans of the Empire found themselves facing a genuine state crisis:

> *The Khans of the Empire found themselves confronting a serious state problem. But at that primitive level of the development of medicine the causes of the disease and its proliferation were not clear. The medics could not offer any effective methods of mass treatment. And then the khans of the Empire made the only, as they thought, correct decision — to wipe out the diseased population of the infected regions using military force. To burn down the houses of the sick. The soldiers were given orders not to come into contact with the infected people. To avoid the local food and water. Swords and all weapons in general had to be disinfected, cleansed with fire and boiled in water.*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, [*How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 5 §38](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_38.html)

Whether the disease was as dangerous as claimed, or whether the fear was amplified to serve political ends, is the critical question. The **pattern** is what matters: a disease spreads, fear is magnified, and the resulting panic produces a **sharp reordering of authority** that benefits those who spread the fear. This pattern would repeat throughout history:

| Event | Disease | Outcome |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **1492 Apocalypse Crusade** | Venereal plagues from brothels | Military conquest of Western Europe; forced conversion; Deep State gains control of the Empire |
| **[1665 Great Plague of London](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.03-1664-ce-the-great-plague-of-1664-1666.md)** | Bubonic plague | Old power structures cleared; Cromwellian and then Restoration authority consolidated |
| **[Spanish Flu (1918–1920)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu)** | H1N1 influenza | Wartime censorship; massive population displacement; League of Nations and post-war global governance structures emerge |
| **[COVID-19 (2020–2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)** | SARS-CoV-2 | Lockdowns, digital surveillance, vaccine mandates; unprecedented centralization of health authority and information control |

Every time a disease spreads — real or amplified — governments across all regions experience an identical response: emergency powers are invoked, civil liberties are suspended, populations are sorted into "clean" and "unclean," and authority consolidates upward. The beneficiaries are always the same class of people. The 1492 Apocalypse Crusade was the **template**.

## The Crusade Itself

The date 1492 CE was specifically chosen by the Deep State as a [mirror of 1492 BCE](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.07.00-the-reverse-exodus-theory.md) — the date of the original Exodus. By 1492 CE, the Apocalypse Crusade had spread throughout western Europe, converting or killing everyone it encountered. This bloody **reset of civilization** changed the nature of the once-eclectic Rus-Horde Empire into a [slave empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Ottoman_Empire) fully under the influence of the Deep State.

The Hordian troops also attacked from Siberia by crossing the Bering Strait into Alaska and traveling south through North America. This incursion was remembered as the [Aztec genocide](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059&context=aujh) of the Mayans.

Fomenko frames the Apocalypse as the Book of the Ottoman Conquest — a record of real events, not mystical prophecy:

> *The Apocalypse is permeated with grim pictures of the Last Judgement… The military aspect of the events taking place is emphasized relentlessly. Jesus is continually depicted with a BATTLE SWORD… Here was a vividly defined picture of the unstoppable military invasion, death, fires and stampedes.*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, [*How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 5 §38](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_38.html)

The segregation of the "diseased" from the "healthy" became the Apocalypse's division of sinners from the righteous. Those deemed unclean — whether because they were actually sick, or simply because they had not submitted to the new order — were marked for destruction. The "pure" (*katharoi*) were those who could demonstrate compliance.

![Four horsemen of the Apocalypse - Vasnetsov](/media/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/apocalypse_vasnetsov.jpg)
*In the apocalyptic imaginary, the great struggle of Horus is reflected in the enterprise of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, which represent the expansion of the Empire to the four cardinal points, and the Christian cross. After this fight a single God, sovereign, imposes itself and begins the journey of the biblical Egyptian exodus, and that of Troy, according to the mythified ancient history.*

## The End of Free Gnostic Christianity

This moment marked a decisive turning point in the history of Christianity itself. Before the Apocalypse Crusade, the dominant form of Christianity in many regions was **free and gnostic** — believers had direct access to the divine through personal revelation, meditation, and community practice. No priest was required as intermediary. No institutional hierarchy stood between the individual and God.

The Apocalypse Crusade ended this. In its aftermath, Christianity was remade into a system that **required priests and doctors for salvation**. The disease panic was the mechanism: if you were sick, only the Church's sanctioned healers could save you. If you were spiritually "unclean," only the Church's priests could absolve you. Salvation was no longer a personal matter — it was an **institutional product**, dispensed by authorized agents and withheld from the disobedient.

*“There were several brothels located in Pompeii — appearing to be part of the Roman culture — that were vastly decorated with pictures representing different sexual similes above the entryways to the cubicles. A fresco from one such brothel depicts a man and woman making love on a bed. The woman is sitting on top of the man with what appears to be a breast band around her chest. Her right arm is outstretched with her hand resting on the bed to the left of his head.” [Source](https://vermiliongoldfishartblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/pompeii-pornography-power/)*

The downstream consequences of this shift defined Western religion for the next five centuries:

- **The Puritans and Shakers** — sects that arose in the post-Apocalypse religious landscape adopted extreme anti-sexual codes as a direct reaction to the bacchanalian culture that had been used as the justification for the Crusade. Their prudishness was not organic moral conviction — it was the **trauma response** of populations that had been told their sexual practices would bring apocalyptic destruction. The Deep State's message was internalized: the body is dangerous, pleasure is sin, and only strict obedience to institutional rules can keep you safe.

- **The [Cathars](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md)** — in contrast to the Puritans, the Cathars rejected both sexuality *and* church-controlled marriage. They followed strict personal rules of celibacy and asceticism — but they did so as a matter of **individual spiritual discipline**, not obedience to an institutional hierarchy. The Cathars refused the corruption of the Church. They refused the priestly intermediary. They were the living remnant of the old free gnostic Christianity. For this reason, they would be the first to be targeted and [*catharized*](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.01-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md) — burned at the stake — by the Church in the post-apocalyptic 16th century. The word *catharize* itself entered the language meaning "purging by fire," encoding the memory of what was done to them.

- **The institutional medical priesthood** — the pattern established in 1492 survives to the present day. The doctor replaced the priest as the arbiter of bodily "salvation." The pharmaceutical system replaced the sacramental system. The quarantine replaced excommunication. The vaccine passport replaced the baptismal certificate. The underlying structure is identical: **access to participation in society is gated by compliance with an institutional authority that claims exclusive jurisdiction over your body.**

## Redaction into Scripture

Later in the 18th century, the [letters of Revelation](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.05.00-1486-ce-revelation-of-the-coming-apocalypse.md) — originally operational military communiqués — were redacted and canonized into the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) and merged with descriptions of a real apocalypse event that occurred at the end of the Golden Age. In the Mormon and Christian Bibles, the event itself would be redacted as the [Story of Noah](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_15.html#the18) escaping the *"flood"* of the wicked. In [Scaligerian history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger), this event was recorded as the [expansion of the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) as well as the [flight of Columbus and the Jews](https://www.israel365news.com/85655/christopher-columbus-jew-led-belief-prophet-isaiah/#HoTDGkY8h4Edbcja.97) from the Inquisition.

The real identity of Christopher Columbus is [unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_theories_of_Christopher_Columbus). This is because the name in Spanish, *Cristóbal Colón*, translates literally to *Colony of Christ* — not a name but a title, describing his function: the man who established Christ's colony across the ocean.
