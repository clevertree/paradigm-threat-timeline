# The Apocalypse Crusade

## Disease as a Weapon of Authority

The Apocalypse Crusade's stated justification was eradication of the **venereal plagues** spread through the [bacchanalian cult](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html#the9) that Fomenko identifies as Western Christianity's dominant form in the XIII–XV centuries. Ceremonial prostitution was part of Western Christian liturgy; brothels operated openly, immortalized in the sexual frescoes of [Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii) — which Fomenko dates to the XV–XVI century, not "79 AD."

The diseases — syphilis chief among them — traveled back to the Rus-Horde Empire along its own trade routes. The Khans made a drastic decision:

> *The Khans of the Empire found themselves confronting a serious state problem… the khans made the only, as they thought, correct decision — to wipe out the diseased population using military force. To burn down the houses of the sick.*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, [*How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 5 §38](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_38.html)

The **pattern** matters more than the specifics: a disease spreads, fear is magnified, and the resulting panic produces a sharp reordering of authority benefiting those who spread the fear. This template repeats: the 1665 Great Plague of London consolidated Restoration authority; the 1918 Spanish Flu enabled post-war global governance; COVID-19 produced unprecedented centralization of health authority and information control. Each time, emergency powers are invoked, populations sorted into "clean" and "unclean," and authority consolidates upward.

## The Crusade Itself

The date 1492 CE was chosen as a [mirror of 1492 BCE](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.07.00-the-reverse-exodus-theory.md). The Crusade swept through Western Europe, converting or killing everyone it encountered, transforming the once-eclectic Rus-Horde Empire into a [slave empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Ottoman_Empire) under Deep State influence. Hordian troops also attacked from Siberia via the Bering Strait into Alaska and south through North America — remembered as the [Aztec genocide](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059&context=aujh) of the Mayans.

## The End of Free Gnostic Christianity

Before the Crusade, the dominant Christianity in many regions was **free and gnostic** — personal revelation, no priestly intermediary. The Crusade ended this. Christianity was remade to **require priests and doctors for salvation**: if you were sick, only the Church's healers could save you; if spiritually "unclean," only priests could absolve you. Salvation became an **institutional product**.

The downstream consequences defined Western religion for centuries. The **Puritans and Shakers** adopted extreme anti-sexual codes as a trauma response — the Deep State's message that pleasure is sin was internalized. The **[Cathars](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md)** rejected both sexuality *and* church-controlled marriage through individual spiritual discipline — refusing the priestly intermediary, they were the living remnant of old gnostic Christianity and the first to be [*catharized*](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.01-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md) (burned at the stake). The **institutional medical priesthood** replaced the old pattern: the doctor replaced the priest, the pharmaceutical system replaced the sacramental system, the quarantine replaced excommunication, the vaccine passport replaced the baptismal certificate.

## Redaction into Scripture

The [letters of Revelation](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.05.00-1486-ce-revelation-of-the-coming-apocalypse.md) — originally operational military communiqués — were later canonized into the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) and merged with descriptions of the real Golden Age apocalypse. In Mormon and Christian Bibles, the event was redacted as [Noah](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_15.html#the18) escaping the "flood." In Scaligerian history, it appears as the [Ottoman expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) and the [flight of Columbus and the Jews](https://www.israel365news.com/85655/christopher-columbus-jew-led-belief-prophet-isaiah/#HoTDGkY8h4Edbcja.97). Christopher Columbus's real identity is [unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_theories_of_Christopher_Columbus) — his Spanish name *Cristóbal Colón* translates to *Colony of Christ*, a title describing his function.
