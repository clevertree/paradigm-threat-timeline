# Revelation of the coming Apocalypse

With this new propaganda tool and new weapons, the **Deep State** once again had the means to cause war in Europe. Now
it was time to formulate **the plan**. A *secret* war plan would have been exposed and would have inevitably failed.
Instead, the **Deep State** placed the plan **in plain sight**, for everyone to see (who could read latin). The book of
this *planned apocalypse* is known
as [The Book of Revelation.](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)

## The Letters to the Seven Churches

Fomenko demonstrates that the Book of Revelation was written in **1486 CE** — six years before the planned apocalypse of
1492 — and that it described not a mystical future event but a **concrete military operation** already in motion
([chronologia.org Ch. 5 §38](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_38.html)). In 1486, the Deep State proliferated
letters to
[7 major churches](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)
in Asia Minor purporting a revelation of events to come, specifically of an impending large-scale military incursion of
western Europe using [armed cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse) to curtail the
widespread disease by **destroying the diseased**. The priests of the Deep State once again justified the war as a
Religious Crusade ordained by God. They justified the slaughter by portraying the victims of disease as sinners who
would incur God's wrath. For many hundreds of thousands of *marked sinners* in Western Europe, this coming apocalypse
was the **End of Days**. As the impending date approached, those who could afford to escape would flee to America's east
coast on [large flotillas](https://www.history.com/news/christopher-columbus-ships-caravels).

These letters were not pastoral epistles. They were **operational communiqués** — addressed to the major power centres of
the eastern Mediterranean to announce the coming campaign, identify loyalties, and flush out opposition.

## Revelation of the Method

This is the intelligence technique known as
**[Revelation of the Method](https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/04/29/revelation-of-the-method/)** (RoM). The principle:
**announce the plan openly before executing it.** The following statement is attributed to the British-intelligence wing
of the [Cryptocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocracy):

> *"This demonstrates one of our simpler methods. Realizing that our activities will sooner or later come to light, we
> structure our activities so that as conspiracy researchers unravel them, they will release information into the public
> consciousness in such a way that it mirrors our initiatory procedure. In this way, the more we are investigated, the
> more masses of people are psychologically processed by the very people who seek to expose us. The meme that
> constitutes our essential structure is then successfully mimicked within the consciousness of those who investigate
> us. Success can then be measured precisely to the extent that our work is exposed."*
> — Quoted in [Michael A. Hoffman II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Hoffman_II), *Secret Societies and
> Psychological Warfare* (2001), ch. "Episodic Revelation and the Lone Nut Syndrome"
> ([interview transcript](https://rielpolitik.com/2019/08/16/secret-societies-the-alchemical-processing-of-humanity-through-public-psychodrama-an-interview-with-michael-hoffman/))

> **Note:** Hoffman attributes this quote to "the British-intelligence wing of the Cryptocracy" but does not name the
> specific source. The original attribution cannot be independently verified at this time — the quote itself appears to
> be suppressed from search engines. We include it here because it is **self-evident**: the mechanism it describes is
> observable in every major operation discussed in this timeline.

Hoffman also writes:

> *"The purpose behind the 'Revelation of the Method' is the implied consent of the populace. If no resistance is
> raised when they reveal the truth, the cryptocracy is free to continue to follow the satanic precept. 'DO WHAT THOU
> WILT IS THE WHOLE OF THE LAW.' In other words, when the cryptocracy reveals their evil manipulations and the MAJORITY
> of the people don't care, it's checkmate."*

### The Revelation Letters as Revelation of the Method

The letters to the seven churches of Asia Minor are, in our view, **the earliest documented instance of Revelation of
the Method**. The Book of Revelation was not prophecy — it was a **war plan announced in advance**, an operational
communiqué dressed in the language of divine authority. This serves multiple purposes:

1. **Identify friends and foes.** Those who receive the announcement and submit voluntarily are allies; those who resist
   reveal themselves as targets. The seven letters sorted the churches into compliant and non-compliant categories —
   praising some, threatening others with destruction.
2. **Demoralize opposition.** When the enemy announces their plan and you cannot stop it, the psychological effect is
   paralysis. Many who read the Revelation letters fled rather than fought — exactly as intended, clearing the
   battlefield before the armies arrived.
3. **Establish perceived inevitability.** By framing the plan as divine prophecy ("the revelation of Jesus Christ"),
   resistance becomes not merely futile but *blasphemous*. Those who fight the plan fight God Himself.
4. **Create plausible deniability for later historians.** Once the operation is complete, the communiqués can be
   re-framed as "mystical prophecy" rather than military planning documents — which is exactly what happened when the
   letters were canonized into the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) in the
   18th century.

The RoM strategy was highly effective. It enabled the Deep State to identify and neutralize any would-be resistance to
the plan. Those who wished to remain in Europe and avoid the slaughter would have to give up their ancient traditions
and submit to the authority of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Rus-Horde Empire.
