# Jesuit Operations: Conversion, Catholicism, and the New World

The Jesuits — the [Secret Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monita_Secreta) — were the primary instrument by which the Deep State spread reformed monotheism globally. Their operations had three objectives: convert indigenous populations, redact Christianity into Rome-controlled Catholicism, and extend the Crusade into the New World. The theological machinery is analysed in [Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md).

## The Founding

The Society of Jesus was established in 1534 by [Ignatius of Loyola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola) with papal approval in 1540. Unlike monastic orders, it was *operational*: mobile, educated, linguistically trained, organized along quasi-military lines with absolute obedience to the Superior General. Ignatius's [*Spiritual Exercises*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Exercises_of_Ignatius_of_Loyola) produced operatives who were intellectually rigorous, culturally adaptive, and willing to die for the mission.

The Jesuits deserve a measure of respect despite serving purposes they often did not understand. Unlike Protestant chronologists who fabricated timelines for political agendas, the Jesuits genuinely documented what they found — languages, histories, cosmologies, astronomical knowledge — even when it contradicted the Catholic narrative. This intellectual honesty makes the Jesuit archive one of the most valuable sources for reconstructing pre-colonial world history.

## The Methodology

1. **Learn the language** — creating first dictionaries and grammars of hundreds of indigenous languages
2. **Document the culture** — religion, cosmology, medicine, governance recorded in annual reports to Rome
3. **Build trust** — schools, hospitals, agricultural assistance
4. **Identify the local deity** — almost universally the Sun — map it onto Jesus Christ
5. **Redirect worship** — gradually replace indigenous ritual with Catholic sacrament

This *pleasant phase* could last decades and was often sincere. But when communities resisted, the escalation followed: missionaries were killed, their deaths publicized across Europe as evidence of "savage" behavior, creating moral and political grounds for military intervention. The Jesuits took the punishment; the empire used their suffering to justify the next conquest.

## Converting Native Religions to Monotheism

The strategy was bifurcated by literacy. **Older, oral populations** accepted Sun = Jesus at face value. **Younger, literate populations** were taught something different: Jesus was the invisible *Son* of the *Creator God Yahweh* (= Saturn), severing the connection to the observable sky permanently. Where persuasion failed, [military special operations](https://sofrep.com/news/soldiers-god-catholicisms-special-operations-force/) were deployed.

## Jesuits Reach America

The 1492 Crusade carried Jesuits westward. In Mesoamerica they encountered populations whose astronomical knowledge was often superior to anything in Europe — the NC identifies these as Hordian colonial provinces. The surviving [Maya codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_codices) — Dresden, Madrid, Paris, and fragmentary Grolier — exist because Jesuits and Franciscans preserved them while the colonial administration destroyed the rest. Bishop [Diego de Landa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_de_Landa) burned hundreds of Maya books in 1562, yet wrote the *Relación de las cosas de Yucatán* — the single most important European source on Maya civilization. Documenting what you simultaneously annihilate is the Jesuit paradox.

The [Guaraní Reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_reduction) of Paraguay — autonomous communities of up to 150,000 under Jesuit governance, protected from Portuguese slavers — were by colonial standards remarkably humane, and for precisely that reason, destroyed. The Treaty of Madrid (1750) transferred Reduction territory to Portugal; the 1756 military campaign dismantled them.
