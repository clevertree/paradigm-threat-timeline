# Jesuit Operations: Conversion, Catholicism, and the New World

The Jesuits — the [Secret Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monita_Secreta) — were the primary
instrument by which the Deep State spread its reformed monotheistic religion to every corner of the conquered
world. Their operations had three interlocking objectives: convert indigenous populations globally, redact
Christianity into a Rome-controlled Catholicism, and extend the Crusade into the New World. The theological
machinery of this operation is analysed in detail in
[Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md).

This article covers the 15th century founding and initial deployment. For subsequent centuries, see the cross-references at the end of this article.

## The Founding of the Society of Jesus

The Society of Jesus was formally established in 1534 by [Ignatius of Loyola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola) and six companions in Paris, receiving papal approval from [Paul III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_III) in 1540. From the outset, the order was designed differently from any existing religious community. It was not monastic — its members did not chant the Divine Office in cloisters. It was *operational*: mobile, educated, linguistically trained, and organized along quasi-military lines with absolute obedience to the Superior General and, through him, to the Pope.

Ignatius's [*Spiritual Exercises*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Exercises_of_Ignatius_of_Loyola) — the training programme every Jesuit underwent — produced a particular type of operative: intellectually rigorous, psychologically resilient, culturally adaptive, and willing to die for the mission. The Jesuits were *not* the brute-force conversion agents that the Inquisition deployed. They were the intelligence and persuasion arm — trained to enter a foreign culture, learn its language fluently, understand its belief system from the inside, and then redirect it toward Catholic monotheism.

This is the essential character of the Jesuit order and the reason it deserves a measure of respect despite serving purposes its members often did not understand. The Jesuits were scholars. They wrote down everything. Unlike the Protestant chronologists who would later fabricate timelines to serve political agendas (see [Deep State erases Russian Empire from all chronology](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.04-1627-ce-deep-state-erases-russian-empire-from-all-chronology.md)), the Jesuits genuinely documented what they found — the languages, the histories, the cosmologies, the astronomical knowledge of every people they encountered — even when that knowledge contradicted the Catholic narrative they were supposedly imposing. This intellectual honesty, embedded in an organization serving ends it didn't fully comprehend, is what makes the Jesuit archive one of the most valuable sources for the reconstruction of pre-colonial world history.

## The Jesuit Methodology: Pretty, Peaceful, Pleasant — Then Deadly

The Jesuit approach to new communities followed a consistent methodology that was, in its initial phase, genuinely gentle:

1. **Learn the language.** Jesuits spent months or years achieving fluency before attempting conversion. They created the first dictionaries and grammars of hundreds of indigenous languages.
2. **Document the culture.** Religion, cosmology, medicine, governance, kinship — everything was recorded in annual reports sent back to Rome.
3. **Build trust.** Schools, hospitals, agricultural assistance. The Jesuits offered material benefits that made their presence welcome.
4. **Identify the local deity.** The primary god was almost universally the Sun — the Jesuits mapped this onto Jesus Christ.
5. **Redirect worship.** Gradually replace indigenous ritual with Catholic sacrament, keeping the calendar dates and some imagery to ease the transition.

This was the *pleasant* phase. It could last years or decades in a given community. And in many cases, it was sincere — individual Jesuits genuinely cared for the communities they entered and advocated for them against colonial exploitation.

But the pleasant phase was always the beginning of a pattern that ended in blood. When communities resisted conversion — as many did — the pattern escalated. Missionaries who were killed, eaten, or burned alive became martyrs whose deaths were publicized across Europe. Each martyrdom created the moral and political grounds for military intervention: the colonial powers could present themselves as rescuing innocent missionaries and their families from "wicked savages," transforming a religious failure into a military pretext.

The Jesuits always took the punishment for the sins of the empire. And the empire always used their suffering to justify the next conquest.

## Jesuits Convert Native Religions to Monotheism

The Jesuits began spreading the [Protestant Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible) around the world
starting with Europe. In assimilating indigenous religions the Jesuits employed a deliberate two-track strategy. They studied each
local belief system and identified its primary deity — which was almost universally the **Sun** — then declared
it to be the same entity as Jesus Christ. This worked because every native solar religion worldwide shared the
same structural allegory: the Sun as saviour, the seasonal death-and-resurrection cycle, the twelve-part year.
(For the full analysis of how the Christ story encodes the Sun's annual zodiacal journey, see
[Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md).)

The strategy was bifurcated by literacy. **Older and oral populations** accepted the Sun = Jesus identification
at face value — additional praise for their already-worshipped saviour. **Younger, literate populations**
were taught something categorically different: that Jesus was the invisible *Son* of the Monotheistic creator
god *Yahweh* — i.e. Planet Saturn — severing the connection to the observable sky permanently.

The Jesuit literature functioned to convert the majority of the populations, but where it didn't work too well
[special military operations forces](https://sofrep.com/news/soldiers-god-catholicisms-special-operations-force/)
were deployed:

> Given that the Jesuits' original mission was to insert into a particularly troubled locale, assess the situation,
> solve whatever problems needed solving, and then redeploy to the next challenge, it is sometimes said that Ignatius
> founded the Jesuits as the "light cavalry" of the Church. And if you have not heard enough military metaphors, Time
> magazine also referred to the order as "the Pope's Marines," due to its emphasis on availability for rapid deployment.
> Fast forward roughly 400 years, and as has been the case with most of the world's military units, mission creep set in
> and the amount, scope, and duration of the taskings handed down to the Jesuits greatly expanded. Thus, the Jesuits
> have transformed over time from a "light cavalry" to more of a "heavy artillery." However, the ideal of availability
> to go wherever they are needed — at a moment's notice — remains strong in the order, and Jesuit priests to this day
> still take a special vow to undertake any assignment given to them by the Pope.

## Jesuits Reach America

The 1492 Crusade carried Jesuit influence westward into the Americas — see
[The Apocalypse Crusade, 1492 CE](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.06.00-1492-ce-the-apocalypse-crusade.md) for the
military context of the Atlantic crossing.

The Jesuit missions in Mesoamerica encountered populations whose astronomical and cosmological knowledge was, in many respects, superior to anything the missionaries had encountered in Europe. The Maya calendar systems, the Aztec cosmological cycles, the Inca astronomical observations — all bore the unmistakable traces of a sophisticated pre-colonial civilization that the NC framework identifies as Hordian colonial provinces.

The Jesuits' response was characteristic: they documented everything they could before the military wing destroyed it. The few surviving Maya codices — the [Dresden Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Codex), the [Madrid Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Codex_(Maya)), the [Paris Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Codex) — survived precisely because Jesuits and Franciscans preserved them even as the colonial administration destroyed the rest. Of the thousands of Maya manuscripts that existed before contact, these three (plus the fragmentary [Grolier Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grolier_Codex)) are all that remain. Bishop [Diego de Landa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_de_Landa) personally supervised the burning of hundreds of Maya books in 1562, yet also wrote the *Relación de las cosas de Yucatán* — the single most important European source on Maya civilization — preserving in text what had been destroyed in image. This contradiction — documenting what you are simultaneously annihilating — is the Jesuit paradox in miniature.

The [Guaraní Reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_reduction) of Paraguay (established from the early 1600s onward) represent the most ambitious Jesuit social experiment: autonomous communities of up to 150,000 Guaraní organized under Jesuit governance, protected from Portuguese slave traders, and operating a communal economy. The Reductions were, by colonial standards, remarkably humane — and for precisely that reason, they were destroyed. The Treaty of Madrid (1750) transferred Reduction territory to Portugal, and the Portuguese-Spanish military campaign of 1756 dismantled the communities. The Jesuits who had built them were expelled.
