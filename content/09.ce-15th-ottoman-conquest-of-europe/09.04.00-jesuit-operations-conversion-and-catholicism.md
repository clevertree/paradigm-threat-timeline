# Jesuit Operations: Conversion, Catholicism, and the New World

The Jesuits — the [Secret Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monita_Secreta) — were the primary
instrument by which the Deep State spread its reformed monotheistic religion to every corner of the conquered
world. Their operations had three interlocking objectives: convert indigenous populations globally, redact
Christianity into a Rome-controlled Catholicism, and extend the Crusade into the New World. The theological
machinery of this operation is analysed in detail in
[Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md).

## Jesuits Convert Native Religions to Monotheism

The Jesuits began spreading the [Protestant Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible) around the world
starting with Europe. In assimilating indigenous religions the Jesuits employed a deliberate two-track strategy. They studied each
local belief system and identified its primary deity — which was almost universally the **Sun** — then declared
it to be the same entity as Jesus Christ. This worked because every native solar religion worldwide shared the
same structural allegory: the Sun as saviour, the seasonal death-and-resurrection cycle, the twelve-part year.
(For the full analysis of how the Christ story encodes the Sun's annual zodiacal journey, see
[Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md).)

The strategy was bifurcated by literacy. **Older and oral populations** accepted the Sun = Jesus identification
at face value — additional praise for their already-worshipped saviour. **Younger, literate populations**
were taught something categorically different: that Jesus was the invisible *Son* of the Monotheistic creator
god *Yahweh* — i.e. Planet Saturn — severing the connection to the observable sky permanently.

The Jesuit literature functioned to convert the majority of the populations, but where it didn't work too well
[special military operations forces](https://sofrep.com/news/soldiers-god-catholicisms-special-operations-force/)
were deployed:

> Given that the Jesuits' original mission was to insert into a particularly troubled locale, assess the situation,
> solve whatever problems needed solving, and then redeploy to the next challenge, it is sometimes said that Ignatius
> founded the Jesuits as the "light cavalry" of the Church. And if you have not heard enough military metaphors, Time
> magazine also referred to the order as "the Pope's Marines," due to its emphasis on availability for rapid deployment.
> Fast forward roughly 400 years, and as has been the case with most of the world's military units, mission creep set in
> and the amount, scope, and duration of the taskings handed down to the Jesuits greatly expanded. Thus, the Jesuits
> have transformed over time from a "light cavalry" to more of a "heavy artillery." However, the ideal of availability
> to go wherever they are needed — at a moment's notice — remains strong in the order, and Jesuit priests to this day
> still take a special vow to undertake any assignment given to them by the Pope.

## Jesuits Reach America

The 1492 Crusade carried Jesuit influence westward into the Americas — see
[The Apocalypse Crusade, 1492 CE](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.06.00-1492-ce-the-apocalypse-crusade.md) for the
military context of the Atlantic crossing.

`TODO` — Expand: Jesuit missions in Mesoamerica, absorption of Aztec/Maya solar religion, destruction of
indigenous codices, forced conversion of the surviving Hordian colonial population in the New World.
