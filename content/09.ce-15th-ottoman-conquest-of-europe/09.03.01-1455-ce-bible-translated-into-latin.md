# Gutenberg Bible translated into Latin

The [Gutenberg Bible](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gutenberg-bible) was a translation of the original Cyrillic
bible into the Vulgate Latin significantly redacting its text and conforming the New Testament narrative to the western
*austere* perspective. For over 200 years, the western Churches refused even to mention the name of Andronicus-Christ,
writing his name down as the letter <code> ι </code>. Now, he would be renamed **Jesus Christ** taking advantage of the
latin alphabet — and elevated to the position of **Son of God**. This rebranding merged the solar
"Son" (the Christ-as-Sun allegory, drawn from ancient zodiacal religion) with the Jovian "Son" (Je-Zeus /
Jupiter as visible representative of the Father) into a single invisible orthodox figure mediating through
Rome. See [Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md)
for the full theological operation. Historians give Johannes Gutenberg credit for the
invention of the printing press in 1454, although it was already in use by the Rus-Horde Empire for at least two
centuries prior. Historians also attribute the translation of the Vulgate Latin Bible to St. Jerome in the *4th*
century, however Fomenko demonstrates this to be a duplicate of the same event shifted backwards by 1053 years.
