# Gutenberg Bible translated into Latin

The [Gutenberg Bible](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gutenberg-bible) was a translation of the original Cyrillic
bible into the Vulgate Latin significantly redacting its text and conforming the New Testament narrative to the western
*austere* perspective. For over 200 years, the western Churches refused even to mention the name of Andronicus-Christ,
writing his name down as the letter <code> ι </code>. Now, he would be renamed **Jesus Christ** taking advantage of the
latin alphabet — and elevated to the position of **Son of God**. This rebranding merged the solar
"Son" (the Christ-as-Sun allegory, drawn from ancient zodiacal religion) with the Jovian "Son" (Je-Zeus /
Jupiter as visible representative of the Father) into a single invisible orthodox figure mediating through
Rome. See [Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md)
for the full theological operation. Historians give Johannes Gutenberg credit for the
invention of the printing press in 1454, although it was already in use by the Rus-Horde Empire for at least two
centuries prior. Historians also attribute the translation of the Vulgate Latin Bible to St. Jerome in the *4th*
century, however Fomenko demonstrates this to be a duplicate of the same event shifted backwards by 1053 years.

# Deep State Steals Russian History

On the Deep State's instructions religious clerics of Europe, after spending 200 years resisting Eastern Christianity,
suddenly would claim it for their own, changing the names, locations, and dates of the Eastern Cyrillic Bible into a
Western Latin version refashioning the stories with Western values. The Deep State saw this new tactic as a solution to
the failure of the Crusades in Europe. The Armies of the Rus-Horde Empire, operating at the behest of the Czar, had
no moral reason to conquer others and were easily demoralized. In contrast, the new Western Crusaders would eventually
call themselves [Warriors of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Warriors).

*Latin is a scientific, authoritarian language with [many rules](https://www.superprof.com/blog/declensions-latin/) and words that are difficult to pronounce. These rules provide a functional basis for [translating Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_translations_of_modern_literature) into other languages, and were designed to supplant indigenous languages into a new hybridized ["Romance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages#List_of_Romance_languages) language.*
