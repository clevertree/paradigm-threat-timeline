# Theory: Latin is the Language of the Deep State

> **Investigative note:** This article presents a hypothesis under active research, synthesising alternative chronology (Fomenko), Saturnian cosmology, and recurring patterns in science fiction.

If the Deep State needed a single administrative language for planetary control, Latin fits the profile: scientific, authoritarian, rule-heavy, difficult to pronounce, and designed to supplant indigenous languages into hybridised ["Romance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) tongues. If Rome was a redaction of the Rus-Horde Empire — which never used Latin — then where did the language come from?

## New Chronology: Latin Was Invented by Imperial Reformists

The most structurally important challenge comes from Fomenko's New Chronology:

**Latin was created in the 15th–17th centuries, not antiquity.** The "ancient" Latin and Greek languages were *"created later, in the epoch of the dissolution of the Empire, based mainly on the Church Slavonic language"* ([ch.4:4](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_4.html)). Reformists invented new languages to *"build language barriers between the populations of the newly-formed states"* ([ch.7:8](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)). In the XIX–XX centuries, scholars erroneously dated Latin's origin into deep antiquity, *"having forgotten that all of this took place relatively recently"* ([ch.8:21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_21.html)).

**Latin appeared on Rus-Horde artefacts** — including a 1618 Damask steel sabre by Russian craftsman Ilya Prosvit ([ch.7:8](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)). This is the hallmark of a *liturgical or administrative language* — not the mother tongue but the **prestige script of a ruling caste**, comparable to Sanskrit in Brahmin India or Classical Arabic across non-Arabic Islamic states.

**Rus-Horde was called "Latinia"** by some sources, possibly from the Russian *LYUDNAYA* ("populous") ([ch.3:7](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html)). The "Latini" were a **political faction** inside the Rus-Horde court linked to heresy and Western European power ([ch.7:25](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_25.html)) — not simply language speakers but a deep-state formation associated with the Empire's eventual fragmentation.

**Petrarch used Latin as a redaction tool** — deliberately *"obscuring the reality of the Middle Ages by substituting it with 'classical antiquity'"* ([ch.5:30](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_30.html)). If the "father of Humanism" used Latin to disguise his living present as classical antiquity, Latin was functioning as a redaction instrument centuries before Scaliger formalised the chronology.

**Latin derives from Church Slavonic.** Fomenko's team traced over 15,800 "foreign" words to ~3,570 Slavonic root groups ([ch.8:21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_21.html)). If Latin derives from the Empire's own language, the "dead language" preserved across every institution is the **living signature of the imperial administration**.

## Fiction That Remembers the Martian-Latin Connection

A transactional analysis of science fiction reveals Latin as the language of a breakaway civilisation: **_A Trip to Mars_** (Rossi, 1920) — Martians speak Latin; **_The War of the Worlds_** (Wells, 1898) — Martians mirror Latin-speaking imperial authority; **_Pilgrims_** (Leonard, 2024) — aliens arrive speaking Latin via the Vatican. The pattern: Latin = the language of those who arrive from above.

## The Martian Origin Hypothesis

If Latin originated on Mars and was transmitted to Earth by a breakaway civilisation, we would expect it to appear gradually during imperial expansion, tied to technological uplift, and imperfectly adopted — precisely Fomenko's fingerprint. The existence of **Vulgar Latin** — dozens of corrupted regional variants — is structural evidence of *failed transmission*: each Romance language shows where an Earth population tried to absorb a language that didn't fit their syntax. The word *vulgar* (from *vulgus*, the common people) encodes the class divide.

Wherever Latin appears in the Fomenko reconstruction, it arrives alongside military conquest, institutional construction, and the systematic naming of every science in Latin — as if a **knowledge transfer** was underway and Latin was the indexing language. An Earthly origin cannot explain why a dead city-state's language indexes all human science. A Martian-origin model explains it directly: the knowledge came *with* the language.

The [British Empire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.06.00-1583-ce-the-british-empire-as-deep-state-instrument.md) inherited this template: the British never spoke Latin, yet their entire institutional framework — *habeas corpus*, *Cestui Que Vie*, *Rex* — operates in Latin, with the London–D.C.–Vatican triangle using it as the shared ceremonial tongue.

## Conclusion

The standard narrative asks us to believe a language spoken by a small Italian population died in the 5th century and spontaneously became every major institution's administrative language out of scholastic nostalgia. The Martian-origin model asks only that the civilisation which transmitted advanced knowledge also transmitted the language in which that knowledge was encoded. **Latin is not a dead language. It is the operational language of a non-Earthly administration — and it is still in use.**
