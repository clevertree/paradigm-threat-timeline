If the Deep State was ever to rule the Earth, it must be able to speak the *same language* as its subjects.
Latin is a scientific, authoritarian language with [many rules](https://www.superprof.com/blog/declensions-latin/) and
words that are difficult to pronounce. These rules provide a functional basis
for [translating Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_translations_of_modern_literature) into other
languages, and were designed to supplant indigenous languages into a new
hybridized ["Romance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages#List_of_Romance_languages) language.

If the memory of Rome was a redaction of the Rus-Horde Empire — which never used Latin — then where did the language
come from? A transactional analysis (see predictive programming) of 20th century science fiction reveals 
Latin as an authorative language that has always been used by a breakaway civilization of humans on Mars. 
As a result of the Deep State / Martian control over Earth, all of our sciences — physics, biology, astronomy, 
even music and religion — are today still written down in the "dead language" of *Latin*.

## Fiction That Remembers the Martian-Latin Connection

The idea of Martians or advanced extraterrestrials communicating in Latin appears across multiple decades of
science fiction. These works are usually dismissed as imaginative fancy, but the consistency of the trope
deserves scrutiny: *why* did multiple independent authors reach for Latin as the alien tongue?

- **_A Trip to Mars_ (1920), Marcianus Rossi** — In this Italian novel, the Martian inhabitants speak Latin.
  The in-universe explanation is that a Roman citizen was transported to Mars during the eruption of **Mount
  Vesuvius in 79 AD**, seeding Martian civilization with Roman language and culture. This is an early,
  explicit literary claim that Rome and Mars are directly connected — not merely symbolically (Mars the war god)
  but linguistically and colonially.

- **_The War of the Worlds_ (1898), H.G. Wells** — While Wells' Martians do not speak Latin, the novel is
  soaked in the implicit metaphor: the technologically superior Martians treating humanity the way the British
  Empire (whose administrative elite was educated exclusively in Latin and Greek) treated colonized peoples.
  The social commentary maps onto the Deep State thesis: a ruling class whose language is inaccessible to the
  governed.

- **Earlier Mars fiction (1880s–1920s)** — Various early speculative works set on Mars employed classical
  languages — Latin or elevated Greek — as shorthand for *civilizational authority*. According to
  [Wikipedia's "Mars in fiction"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_in_fiction) overview, early 20th-century
  authors frequently reached for classical-education markers to signal that Martian civilization was *older
  and superior* to Earth's. The choice of Latin was not arbitrary: it was the only language on Earth that
  signalled a transnational, institutionally-controlled elite.

- **_Pilgrims_ (2024), M.R. Leonard** — In this contemporary sci-fi thriller, aliens arrive on Earth and
  communicate exclusively in Latin. The story centres on the Vatican as the contact point. The framing is
  notable: the Church — historically the institution most responsible for preserving, standardising, and
  *restricting access to* Latin — is the alien interlocutor. Whether intentional or not, the novel maps
  the Deep State thesis almost literally.

The pattern across a century of fiction: Latin = the language of those who arrive from above, who already
know Earth's history better than Earth does, and who communicate through institutions (the Church, the
academy, the state) rather than directly with populations.

## New Chronology: Latin Was Invented by Imperial Reformists

The most structurally important challenge to the "ancient dead language" narrative comes from Russian
mathematician **Anatoly Fomenko** and his New Chronology project, mirrored at
[chronologia.org](https://chronologia.org/). Key claims from their research (citations from the English
translation of *How It Was In Reality*):

### Latin Was Created in the 15th–17th Centuries, Not Antiquity

> *"The 'ancient' Latin and 'ancient' Greek languages were created later, in the epoch of the dissolution of
> the Empire, based mainly on the Church Slavonic language."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.4:4](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_4.html)

> *"The reformists quickly invent and energetically introduce the new languages based on the former Imperial
> state Church-Slavonic language and the local dialects in the provinces which acquired their independence.
> For example, French, German, Spanish, English and also 'ancient' Latin and 'ancient' Greek. This allowed
> the rebels to build language barriers between the populations of the newly-formed states."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:8](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)

> *"In the XIX–XX cc. they began the 'reconstruction of the history of the ancient languages', erroneously
> dating their origin (Latin for example) into the deepest antiquity. Having forgotten that all of this took
> place relatively recently, just 150–200 years ago."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.8:21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_21.html)

In other words, Fomenko's analysis concludes that Latin was **not** a language that died in the 5th century
AD and was then preserved by scholars. It was **fabricated** as a control language during the break-up of
the Rus-Horde Empire, in the 15th–17th centuries — roughly the same period the Roman Catholic Church was
consolidated and the Scaligerian chronological framework was constructed.

### Latin Was Used *Within* the Rus-Horde Court System

Despite Fomenko's argument that the Rus-Horde Empire did not natively use Latin, he documents that **Latin
inscriptions and Latin letters appear on Rus-Horde artefacts**:

> *"They also made weaponry with LATIN inscriptions in Russia. Or at least they used the Latin letters.
> As, for example, the precious Damask steel sabre made by the RUSSIAN craftsman Ilya Prosvit in 1618."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:8](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)

This is the hallmark of a *liturgical or administrative language* — not the mother tongue of a civilization,
but the **prestige script of its ruling caste**. Comparable to: Sanskrit in Brahmin India, Classical Arabic
across non-Arabic Islamic states, or Church Slavonic in Orthodox Russia. The ruling class writes in a
language the governed cannot read.

### Rus-Horde Was Called "Latinia" / "Ruthenia"

> *"Some sources call RUTHENIA LATINIA by way of confusing letters 'R' and 'L'. The name LATINIA could
> have also originated from a Russian word 'LYUDNAYA' meaning 'POPULOUS' (country)."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.3:7](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html)

The conflation of Russia/Ruthenia with Latinia in medieval sources is a significant data point. If the
Rus-Horde Empire was *called* Latinia by Western chroniclers, then "Latin" may be an exonym for the
Empire's administrative language as perceived by outsiders — not the name the Empire used for itself.

### The "Latini" as a Faction Within the Empire

Fomenko also identifies a specific **political faction** called the "Latini" operating within and against
the Rus-Horde court:

> *"The throne is surrounded by a tight ring of Esther's supporters — the Judaizers, Protestants,
> 'Latini'. The Czar takes their side in supporting heresy."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:25](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_25.html)

> *"Horde loses its control over Protestant, 'Latin', Western Europe."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:25](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_25.html)

Here the Latini are a **faction** — a deep-state formation within the Empire — not simply speakers of a
language. They are associated with heresy, Western European power, and the eventual fragmentation of the
Rus-Horde order. This aligns with the broader thesis: Latin was not just a linguistic artefact but the
**operational language of a separating faction** that eventually built what we call Western civilization.

### Petrarch Deliberately Used Latin to Erase the Medieval Present

> *"Petrarch strived — allegedly on purpose — TO OBSCURE THE REALITY OF THE MIDDLE AGES BY SUBSTITUTING IT
> WITH 'CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY'. When addressing his contemporaries, he used the ancient nicknames and names...
> meaning that he wrote the way as if he 'lived in an ancient time'."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.5:30](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_30.html)

If Petrarch — the "father of Humanism" — deliberately used Latin to disguise his own living present as
classical antiquity, then **Latin was already functioning as a redaction tool** centuries before the
Scaligerian chronology was formalised.

### Latin Derived from Church Slavonic (Structural Evidence)

Fomenko's team constructed a dictionary of over 15,800 "foreign" (Latin, English, German) words traceable
to approximately 3,570 Slavonic root groups:

> *"HAVING ESTABLISHED THE ORIGIN OF THE 'CLASSICAL LATIN' FROM THE SLAVONIC ROOT, WE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY
> PRESENT A NUMBER OF SLAVONIC ROOTS IN OTHER WESTERN-EUROPEAN LANGUAGES."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.8:21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_21.html)

The structural implication: if Latin is derived from the language of the Rus-Horde Empire (Church Slavonic),
and that Empire also controlled major scientific, religious, and administrative institutions, then the
"dead language" preserved across all those institutions is not dead at all — it is the **living signature
of the imperial administration** written into every science, law code, and church ceremony that followed.

## The Martian Origin Hypothesis: A Language Introduced From Outside

If Latin originated on Mars and was *introduced* to Earth by a breakaway or off-world civilization, we
would expect a very specific fingerprint in the historical record. It would **not** appear fully-formed in
an isolated culture that independently developed it. Instead, it would appear:

1. **Gradually** — seeping into Earth institutions rather than erupting natively from a single people.
2. **Tied to periods of technological uplift** — appearing wherever "advanced" civilizational capability
   was transferred: astronomy, metallurgy, medicine, law, mathematics.
3. **Interlaced with power struggles and war** — the faction holding the language would hold leverage,
   making Latin-use a political act rather than a cultural one.
4. **Imperfectly adopted** — Earth populations receiving an alien language would produce corrupted,
   fragmented, and regionalized versions of it, just as a language being learned by non-native speakers
   always drifts.

Fomenko's New Chronology, read through this lens, fits the Martian-origin model **more naturally than it
fits any purely Earthly explanation**.

### The Gradual Infiltration: Latin Appears During Imperial Expansion, Not Before It

According to Fomenko, Latin does not precede the great empires — it *follows* their consolidation and
then their fragmentation. It emerges as a prestige administrative language in the 13th–17th century
window — precisely when the Rus-Horde Empire was at its apex and then breaking apart. This is not how
a language of a native people behaves. A native language precedes the empire. A **transmitted** language
arrives with the technology and authority that enabled the empire in the first place.

The pattern mirrors what we see whenever a technologically superior group makes contact with a less
advanced one: the dominant group's language becomes the administrative tongue, imposed top-down, never
fully absorbed at the popular level. Latin was never spoken natively by the majority of any population
in any era. It was always the language of the *institution over* the people, not *of* the people.

### Vulgar Latin: Evidence of Failed Transmission

One of the most revealing anomalies in the standard Latin narrative is the existence and documented
proliferation of **Vulgar Latin** — the term used by scholars for the corrupted, highly variable spoken
forms of Latin used by common populations across the Roman world. The official story presents Vulgar
Latin as a natural "degradation" of Classical Latin over time.

But this framing has it backwards.

If Latin were a living native language that arose organically from a European population, there would
be **one** proto-Latin with regional drift — the normal evolution of any language. What we actually have
is the opposite structure:

- A rigid, hyper-formalised **Classical Latin** that almost no one spoke natively and that required
  years of formal instruction to use correctly.
- Dozens of divergent **Vulgar Latin** variants across geographically distant regions, many of which
  do not derive cleanly from Classical Latin but appear to be **independent hybridizations** of the
  formal script with local Slavonic, Turkic, Germanic, and Celtic speech patterns.
- A scholarly tradition that laboured for centuries to *reconstruct* proper Latin from first principles,
  as though the original were a foreign artifact being reverse-engineered rather than a heritage language
  being maintained.

This is precisely what you would expect if an off-world or breakaway civilization had **transmitted a
formal language to Earth populations who did not grow up speaking it**. The ruling caste learned it
properly (because they had direct access to the transmitters). The subject population received an
approximation — "Vulgar Latin" — assembled from whatever overlap existed between the alien formal
script and their native tongues. The word *vulgar* itself, from Latin *vulgus* (the common people),
encodes the class divide in the language's very taxonomy: there is the Latin of those who received
it correctly, and the Latin of those who didn't.

The Romance languages — French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian — are not the natural evolution
of a single spoken tongue. They are **seven distinct failed transmissions** of the same formal script,
each one showing the seams where an Earth population tried to absorb a language that did not fit their
vocal anatomy, syntax intuitions, or cultural memory.

### Latin Arrives With Technology, War, and the Transfer of Power

Wherever Latin appears in the Fomenko reconstruction, it arrives alongside:

- **Military conquest** — the expansion of the Rus-Horde / Ottoman axis across Eurasia, Africa, and
  the Americas in the 13th–16th centuries.
- **Institutional construction** — the building of the Church, universities, legal codes, and scientific
  academies, all of which adopted Latin as their foundational language.
- **Technological cataloguing** — the naming of every new scientific discipline, every newly classified
  organism, every newly mapped astronomical body, done in Latin, as though a systematic **knowledge
  transfer** was underway and Latin was the indexing language of the incoming knowledge base.

An Earthly origin for Latin cannot explain why the language of a supposedly extinct Italian city-state
became the *indexing tongue of all human scientific knowledge*. A Martian-origin model explains it
directly: the knowledge being catalogued in Latin *came with the language*. The sciences were not
translated into Latin by human scholars. They were received in Latin, because Latin was the language
of the civilization that provided them.

## Conclusion: Latin Is Not From Earth

When all known facts are laid against each other, the Mars breakaway civilization hypothesis fits more
cleanly than any alternative:

| Observation | Earthly Explanation | Martian-Origin Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Latin appears gradually during imperial expansion | Language of a growing empire | Transmitted language spreading with the transmitters' reach |
| Vulgar Latin: dozens of corrupted regional variants | Natural linguistic drift | Non-native populations imperfectly adopting an alien formal language |
| Classical Latin rigid, almost never spoken natively | Prestige dialect | Transmitter's language, preserved formally by those with direct access |
| All sciences indexed in Latin | Historical accident of Roman dominance | Knowledge was received in Latin — it came with the language |
| Latin declared "dead" yet persists in every major institution | Tradition / conservatism | Never dead — still the operational language of the transmitting faction |
| Rus-Horde called "Latinia" externally | Confusion of R and L in spelling | Latin was visibly the Empire's prestige script; outsiders named the Empire after it |
| "Latini" faction inside Rus-Horde court, linked to heresy and Western fragmentation | Political faction adopting Roman identity | Faction with direct access to the off-world transmitters, using the language as a credential |
| Fomenko: Latin derived from Slavonic, invented 15th–17th c. | Language construction project by reformists | Slavonic-Latin overlap reflects the transmission interface: Latin imposed onto a Slavonic-speaking population |
| SF tradition of Martians speaking Latin, spanning 100+ years | Imaginative coincidence | Authors drawing on a cultural memory that was never fully suppressed |

The standard narrative asks us to believe that a language spoken by a small Italian population died
completely in the 5th century, was then preserved by monks for a thousand years with no native speakers,
and spontaneously became the administrative language of every major institution on Earth — church,
university, law, medicine, astronomy, biology, chemistry — purely out of scholastic nostalgia.

The Martian-origin model asks nothing implausible. It asks only that we take seriously the possibility
that the civilization which *transmitted* advanced knowledge to Earth *also* transmitted the language
in which that knowledge was encoded. Latin is not a dead language. It is not a Roman language. It is
the **operational language of a non-Earthly administration** — and it is still in use.

**We can conclude: Latin is not from Earth.**
