If the Deep State was ever to rule the Earth, it must be able to speak the *same language* as its subjects.
Latin is a scientific, authoritarian language with [many rules](https://www.superprof.com/blog/declensions-latin/) and
words that are difficult to pronounce. These rules provide a functional basis
for [translating Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_translations_of_modern_literature) into other
languages, and were designed to supplant indigenous languages into a new
hybridized ["Romance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages#List_of_Romance_languages) language.

If the memory of Rome was a redaction of the Rus-Horde Empire — which never used Latin — then where did the language
come from? A transactional analysis (see predictive programming) of 20th century science fiction reveals 
Latin as an authorative language that has always been used by a breakaway civilization of humans on Mars. 
As a result of the Deep State / Martian control over Earth, all of our sciences — physics, biology, astronomy, 
even music and religion — are today still written down in the "dead language" of *Latin*.

## Fiction That Remembers the Martian-Latin Connection

The idea of Martians communicating in Latin recurs across a century of science fiction: **_A Trip to Mars_** (Rossi, 1920) — Martian inhabitants speak Latin, seeded by a Roman citizen transported during the Vesuvius eruption; **_The War of the Worlds_** (Wells, 1898) — Martians treat humanity as the Latin-educated British Empire treated colonial subjects; early Mars fiction (1880s–1920s) used classical languages as shorthand for civilisational authority; and **_Pilgrims_** (Leonard, 2024) — aliens arrive speaking Latin, with the Vatican as contact point. The pattern: Latin = the language of those who arrive from above, who already know Earth's history, and who communicate through institutions rather than directly with populations.

## New Chronology: Latin Was Invented by Imperial Reformists

The most structurally important challenge to the "ancient dead language" narrative comes from Russian
mathematician **Anatoly Fomenko** and his New Chronology project, mirrored at
[chronologia.org](https://chronologia.org/). Key claims from their research (citations from the English
translation of *How It Was In Reality*):

### Latin Was Created in the 15th–17th Centuries, Not Antiquity

> *"The 'ancient' Latin and 'ancient' Greek languages were created later, in the epoch of the dissolution of
> the Empire, based mainly on the Church Slavonic language."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.4:4](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_4.html)

> *"The reformists quickly invent and energetically introduce the new languages based on the former Imperial
> state Church-Slavonic language and the local dialects in the provinces which acquired their independence.
> For example, French, German, Spanish, English and also 'ancient' Latin and 'ancient' Greek. This allowed
> the rebels to build language barriers between the populations of the newly-formed states."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:8](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)

> *"In the XIX–XX cc. they began the 'reconstruction of the history of the ancient languages', erroneously
> dating their origin (Latin for example) into the deepest antiquity. Having forgotten that all of this took
> place relatively recently, just 150–200 years ago."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.8:21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_21.html)

In other words, Fomenko's analysis concludes that Latin was **not** a language that died in the 5th century
AD and was then preserved by scholars. It was **fabricated** as a control language during the break-up of
the Rus-Horde Empire, in the 15th–17th centuries — roughly the same period the Roman Catholic Church was
consolidated and the Scaligerian chronological framework was constructed.

### Latin Was Used *Within* the Rus-Horde Court System

Despite Fomenko's argument that the Rus-Horde Empire did not natively use Latin, he documents that **Latin
inscriptions and Latin letters appear on Rus-Horde artefacts**:

> *"They also made weaponry with LATIN inscriptions in Russia. Or at least they used the Latin letters.
> As, for example, the precious Damask steel sabre made by the RUSSIAN craftsman Ilya Prosvit in 1618."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:8](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html)

This is the hallmark of a *liturgical or administrative language* — not the mother tongue of a civilization,
but the **prestige script of its ruling caste**. Comparable to: Sanskrit in Brahmin India, Classical Arabic
across non-Arabic Islamic states, or Church Slavonic in Orthodox Russia. The ruling class writes in a
language the governed cannot read.

### Rus-Horde Was Called "Latinia" / "Ruthenia"

> *"Some sources call RUTHENIA LATINIA by way of confusing letters 'R' and 'L'. The name LATINIA could
> have also originated from a Russian word 'LYUDNAYA' meaning 'POPULOUS' (country)."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.3:7](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html)

The conflation of Russia/Ruthenia with Latinia in medieval sources is a significant data point. If the
Rus-Horde Empire was *called* Latinia by Western chroniclers, then "Latin" may be an exonym for the
Empire's administrative language as perceived by outsiders — not the name the Empire used for itself.

### The "Latini" as a Faction Within the Empire

Fomenko also identifies a specific **political faction** called the "Latini" operating within and against
the Rus-Horde court:

> *"The throne is surrounded by a tight ring of Esther's supporters — the Judaizers, Protestants,
> 'Latini'. The Czar takes their side in supporting heresy."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:25](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_25.html)

> *"Horde loses its control over Protestant, 'Latin', Western Europe."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.7:25](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_25.html)

Here the Latini are a **faction** — a deep-state formation within the Empire — not simply speakers of a
language. They are associated with heresy, Western European power, and the eventual fragmentation of the
Rus-Horde order. This aligns with the broader thesis: Latin was not just a linguistic artefact but the
**operational language of a separating faction** that eventually built what we call Western civilization.

### Petrarch Deliberately Used Latin to Erase the Medieval Present

> *"Petrarch strived — allegedly on purpose — TO OBSCURE THE REALITY OF THE MIDDLE AGES BY SUBSTITUTING IT
> WITH 'CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY'. When addressing his contemporaries, he used the ancient nicknames and names...
> meaning that he wrote the way as if he 'lived in an ancient time'."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.5:30](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_30.html)

If Petrarch — the "father of Humanism" — deliberately used Latin to disguise his own living present as
classical antiquity, then **Latin was already functioning as a redaction tool** centuries before the
Scaligerian chronology was formalised.

### Latin Derived from Church Slavonic (Structural Evidence)

Fomenko's team constructed a dictionary of over 15,800 "foreign" (Latin, English, German) words traceable
to approximately 3,570 Slavonic root groups:

> *"HAVING ESTABLISHED THE ORIGIN OF THE 'CLASSICAL LATIN' FROM THE SLAVONIC ROOT, WE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY
> PRESENT A NUMBER OF SLAVONIC ROOTS IN OTHER WESTERN-EUROPEAN LANGUAGES."*
> — [chronologia.org, ch.8:21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_21.html)

The structural implication: if Latin is derived from the language of the Rus-Horde Empire (Church Slavonic),
and that Empire also controlled major scientific, religious, and administrative institutions, then the
"dead language" preserved across all those institutions is not dead at all — it is the **living signature
of the imperial administration** written into every science, law code, and church ceremony that followed.

## The Martian Origin Hypothesis

If Latin originated on Mars and was introduced to Earth by a breakaway civilisation, we would expect it to appear gradually during imperial expansion (not before it), tied to technological uplift, interlaced with power struggles, and imperfectly adopted — precisely the fingerprint Fomenko's reconstruction reveals. Latin does not precede the great empires; it follows their consolidation and fragmentation, emerging as a prestige language in the 13th–17th century window. A native language precedes the empire; a **transmitted** language arrives with the technology and authority that enabled the empire.

### Vulgar Latin: Evidence of Failed Transmission

The existence of **Vulgar Latin** — dozens of corrupted regional variants — is the strongest structural evidence. If Latin arose organically from a European population, there would be one proto-Latin with regional drift. Instead we have a rigid, hyper-formalised Classical Latin that almost no one spoke natively, alongside dozens of divergent Vulgar variants that appear to be independent hybridisations of the formal script with local Slavonic, Turkic, Germanic, and Celtic speech. The Romance languages — French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian — are not the natural evolution of one spoken tongue but **distinct failed transmissions** of the same formal script, each showing the seams where an Earth population tried to absorb a language that did not fit their syntax intuitions or cultural memory. The word *vulgar* itself (from *vulgus*, the common people) encodes the class divide: the Latin of those who received it correctly vs. those who didn't.

### Latin Arrives With Technology

Wherever Latin appears in the Fomenko reconstruction, it arrives alongside military conquest, institutional construction (Church, universities, legal codes), and the systematic naming of every scientific discipline in Latin — as if a **knowledge transfer** was underway and Latin was the indexing language of the incoming knowledge base. An Earthly origin cannot explain why the language of a supposedly extinct city-state became the indexing tongue of all human science. A Martian-origin model explains it directly: the knowledge came *with* the language.

The [British Empire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.06.00-1583-ce-the-british-empire-as-deep-state-instrument.md) later inherited this template: the British people never spoke Latin, yet the entire institutional framework — *habeas corpus*, *Cestui Que Vie*, *Rex* — operates in Latin, and the London–D.C.–Vatican triangle employs it as the shared ceremonial tongue of a system the British people are also subject to.

## Conclusion: Latin Is Not From Earth

When all known facts are laid against each other, the Mars breakaway civilization hypothesis fits more
cleanly than any alternative:

| Observation | Earthly Explanation | Martian-Origin Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Latin appears gradually during imperial expansion | Language of a growing empire | Transmitted language spreading with the transmitters' reach |
| Vulgar Latin: dozens of corrupted regional variants | Natural linguistic drift | Non-native populations imperfectly adopting an alien formal language |
| Classical Latin rigid, almost never spoken natively | Prestige dialect | Transmitter's language, preserved formally by those with direct access |
| All sciences indexed in Latin | Historical accident of Roman dominance | Knowledge was received in Latin — it came with the language |
| Latin declared "dead" yet persists in every major institution | Tradition / conservatism | Never dead — still the operational language of the transmitting faction |
| Rus-Horde called "Latinia" externally | Confusion of R and L in spelling | Latin was visibly the Empire's prestige script; outsiders named the Empire after it |
| "Latini" faction inside Rus-Horde court, linked to heresy and Western fragmentation | Political faction adopting Roman identity | Faction with direct access to the off-world transmitters, using the language as a credential |
| Fomenko: Latin derived from Slavonic, invented 15th–17th c. | Language construction project by reformists | Slavonic-Latin overlap reflects the transmission interface: Latin imposed onto a Slavonic-speaking population |
| SF tradition of Martians speaking Latin, spanning 100+ years | Imaginative coincidence | Authors drawing on a cultural memory that was never fully suppressed |

The standard narrative asks us to believe a language spoken by a small Italian population died in the 5th century, was preserved by monks for a thousand years with no native speakers, and spontaneously became the administrative language of every major institution on Earth — church, university, law, medicine, astronomy — purely out of scholastic nostalgia.

The Martian-origin model asks only that we take seriously the possibility that the civilisation which transmitted advanced knowledge to Earth also transmitted the language in which that knowledge was encoded. **Latin is not a dead language. It is the operational language of a non-Earthly administration — and it is still in use.**
