# March 23 - Priori-Mars loses its outer shell - Iron Age Begins

On the 9th close encounter with Earth,
[Priori-Mars](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/2017/11/19/castle-deep-in-lake-van/)
finally grows unstable enough to lose its outer shell forever. The centuries of interplanetary electric discharge had
converted the light elements in the outer shell into heavy iron, and now the shell was too heavy to retain.
[Ackerman](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/ackerman/ackerman-mythology_greek.html#prometheus)
explains the break-up:

> Its release was influenced by the tidal force of
> proto-Venus, when the latter's inferior conjunctions corresponded to
> its aphelions. At these times the solid core of priori-Mars exited
> the planet and swooped into a lower orbit around the Earth while the
> outer shell drifted away. The two recombined as they left the
> vicinity of the Earth and reformed during the fifteen years that it
> orbited the Sun. After the *final* encounter,
> the outer shell of priori-Mars failed to recombine with its solid
> core and slid out to its current orbit, forming the low density
> planet we now call Mars.

The iron shell of Mars permanently came apart forming
the [asteroid belt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCOTNboQqV8&feature=emb_title) and
scattering [star metal](https://conananimated.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Metal) across the Earth's surface. This event
kick-starts the [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age)
as humanity receives one more parting gift of **metallurgy** from Prometheus before Mars vanishes forever into its
final orbit - appearing as a red speck in the night sky. On June 15 685 B.C.E., absent from the extended magnetosphere of
Priori-Mars, Mercury (known as [Phaethon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Phaethon-Greek-mythology))
and Venus both caught on fire. On July 9th, Jupiter catches on fire. 5 days later on July 14th, Jupiter releases a
plasmoid bolt which travels for 11 days and strikes the Sun on the 25th. This event was remembered throughout
Mesoamerica as the [Death of Quetzalcoatl](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingQuetzalcoatl.html). The
planets were striking their final electromagnetic balance and fixing their orbits that we know today.
