# Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism

The Deep State was able to now trigger wars on Earth, but in order to maintain control over conquered territories, it
needed to deploy a "slave" version of its monotheistic religion upon the conquered nations. However, it would have been
impossible to convert the Horde and all of its vassal nations into a doctrine which was quite antithetical to those
embraced by Gnostic Christians. The only solution was to supplant and redact Christianity itself into a new religion -
*Catholicism*. Thus, the [Secret Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monita_Secreta) was created.

*The Jesuit operation: indigenous solar religion — in which Christ was the Sun traversing the Zodiac — was systematically overwritten into an invisible, Rome-mediated monotheism.*

## Christ as a Solar Allegory: What Was Redacted

To understand the depth of the redaction it is necessary to understand what Christianity *was* before it became Catholicism.
The ancient world did not separate religion from astronomy. The sky was the cathedral — every people on Earth,
from the Quiche Maya to the Vedic Indians to the Hellenistic Greeks, encoded their theology in the movements of the Sun,
Moon, and planets. The story now called "The Life of Christ" is, at its structural core, an **astrological allegory for
the annual passage of the Sun through the twelve houses of the Zodiac**.

This was not a fringe claim. As the research archive at [solarmythology.com](https://solarmythology.com/) documents, the
knowledge was documented openly in the early 19th century before being effectively suppressed again:

> *"There is evidence that people were well aware of it at the time of the formation of the Catholic Church. There is
> also evidence that these people were eliminated by the Catholic Church and all books exposing the allegory were burned."*
> — *History of Research into Solar Mythology and the Bible*, solarmythology.com

Key works rediscovering this knowledge:
- **Charles François Dupuis** (1742–1809), *The Origin of All Religious Worship* (1798) — Chapter IX: *"An Explanation of the Fable, in which the Sun is worshipped under the name of Christ"*
- **Constantin François de Volney** (1757–1820), *The Ruins* (1791) — Chapter XIII: *"Christianity, or the Allegorical Worship of the Sun under the cabalistic names of Chrish-en or Christ and Yesus or Jesus"*
- **Rev. Robert Taylor** (1784–1844), *The Diegesis* (1829) — argued that earliest Christians intended the Christ figure as *"a personification of the principle of reason"*, not a historical person
- **Lyman E. Stowe**, *Stowe's Bible Astrology* (1907) — documented the full zodiacal correspondence of the Jesus ministry
- **Acharya S** (D.M. Murdock), *The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold* (1999) — comprehensive comparative mythology analysis

## The Zodiac Ministry: The Sun's Annual Journey Encoded as Gospel

The structural parallels are precise enough to constitute a cipher, not a coincidence:

| Solar Event | Gospel Parallel |
|---|---|
| Sun **reborn** on Dec. 25 (3 days after Winter Solstice "death") | Jesus **born** on December 25; *resurrected* after 3 days |
| Sun travels through **12 houses** of the Zodiac in one year | Jesus has **12 disciples**; ministry lasts **one year** |
| Sun enters **Aquarius** (water-bearer) ~Jan. 20, rainy season | Jesus begins ministry visiting **John the Baptist** (baptism with water) |
| Sun enters **Pisces** (fish) | Jesus recruits **fishermen** as disciples; fish iconography everywhere |
| Sun enters **Aries** (the Lamb) | Jesus becomes the **Good Shepherd**; "Lamb of God" |
| Sun enters **Taurus** (the Bull, plowing season) | **Feeding the multitudes**; agricultural salvation imagery |
| Sun enters **Gemini** (the Twins, increase) | Parables of **multiplication and growth** |
| Sun enters **Cancer** (the Crab, which walks backward) — summer solstice | Jesus speaks of **backsliders**; days now *shorten* (John the Baptist "decreases") |
| Sun at **Vernal Equinox**, crossing the celestial equator | **Crucifixion** = *cross*-ification. The sun crosses (+) the equinox. Passover = *pass-over* of the equinox |
| Sun **ascends** after spring equinox | **Resurrection and Ascension** into heaven |
| Sun's face in full summer glory | Matthew 17:2 — *"His face shone like the sun"* |
| Sun **sets** (disappears) | John 12:35-36 — *"Jesus left and hid himself from them"* |

The name **Bethlehem** itself confirms the cipher. In Hebrew, *Beth* = "house" (as in each of the 12 zodiacal houses),
and *lehem* (לֶחֶם) = "bread." **Bethlehem = "House of Bread."** The only zodiacal house of bread is **Virgo**,
traditionally depicted holding a sheaf of grain. Mary (the mother of Jesus) = Virgo. Joseph = Saturn (in medieval
iconography Joseph is consistently depicted holding Saturn's symbols). The Magi (Three Wise Men) = the three stars of
Orion's Belt, which, as the celestial sphere rotates during the night, appear to lead toward the rising of Virgo on the
eastern horizon. The Star of Bethlehem = Venus, always near the Sun.

**Scripture that only makes sense if Jesus is the Sun:**

> *"I am the light of the world."* — John 8:12, John 9:5  
> *"The people living in darkness have seen a great light."* — Matthew 4:16  
> *"His face shone like the sun."* — Matthew 17:2  
> *"While you have the light, walk in the light, before darkness overtakes you... Jesus left and hid himself from them."* — John 12:35-36  
> *"Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made."* — John 1:3 *(without the Sun, nothing grows)*

## Mo-Zeus and Je-Zeus: The Planet Jupiter Rebranded

Before the Jesuit redaction, the "Son of God" in the ancient cosmological tradition was not invisible — it was
**visible every night** as the brightest wandering star in the sky: **Jupiter**.

The etymological chain is deliberate and traces the successive rebranding operations:

- **Zeus** (Greek) = **Jupiter** (Roman) — the king of the visible gods, the great planetary deity, the "Father" of the Olympian order
- **Mo-Zeus** → **Moses** — Moses as a solar/Jovian prophet-king figure; his radiant face after the Sinai encounter
  (Exodus 34:29-35, *"his face shone"*) and his role as lawgiver mirrors Jupiter's kingly function. The "Horns of Moses"
  in Michelangelo's famous sculpture are the same radiant rays used to depict solar deities (a mistranslation of *qaran*,
  meaning both "horned" and "radiant")
- **Je-Zeus** → **Iesous** (Greek) → **Jesus** — the Hellenized Hebrew *Yeshua*, but whose Greek form *Iesous* embeds
  the name **Zeus** directly: *Ie-Zeus*. Volney (1791) transcribed this explicitly as *"Yesus or Jesus"*

The theological operation performed was as follows:

> The old solar religion had *two distinct visible Sons*: the **Sun itself** (the daily/seasonal deity, the Christ
> allegory) and **Jupiter** (the "Father God's" visible representative, the lawgiver, the judge). Indigenous populations
> across Europe, the Near East, and the Americas already worshipped these under local names — Mithras, Horus, Osiris,
> Quetzalcoatl, Dionysus, Krishna, Apollo, Baldur — all exhibiting the same solar-birth/death/resurrection structure.
>
> The Jesuit-Catholic redaction **merged both** into one invisible, transcendent figure: the Christ of orthodoxy.
> All attributes of the Sun (light, life, resurrection, seasonal rebirth) were absorbed by this new figure. All
> attributes of Jupiter (law, judgment, kingship, the written covenant) were absorbed by the same figure. The result was
> a **monopoly deity** that could not be cross-referenced against any observable phenomenon in nature or sky.
>
> This was the genius of the operation: by making God *invisible*, the Church made itself the **sole interpreter** of
> God's will. The old priests could point to the sky and say "there is God" — anyone could verify it. The new priests
> pointed to a text *they alone controlled* and said "here is God's word."

This is what Dupuis meant in 1798 when he titled his chapter: *"An Explanation of the Fable, in which the Sun is
worshipped under the name of Christ."* He was not making a new discovery — he was recovering a truth already well-known
in his era before the 19th-century Catholic resurgence buried it again.

## The Suppression: Forced Conversion by Pain of Death

The mechanism of conversion was not persuasion — it was **terror**. Indigenous solar religion did not peacefully evolve
into Catholicism. It was **exterminated and its memory replaced**.

Evidence of the methodology:

1. **Destruction of astronomical/religious libraries** — The Catholic Church's burning of books documenting the solar
   allegory is documented in solar mythology research. The Library of Alexandria, the Mayan codices (of which only four
   survive from thousands), Aztec pictographic manuscripts — systematic erasure of indigenous cosmological records.

2. **Conflation of indigenous gods with demons** — The Church's missionary strategy, documented in its own records,
   was to identify local solar and planetary deities as "devils" and their worship as diabolism, making continued
   practice punishable by death. The Inquisition's primary function was enforcement of this conversion.

3. **Absorption of solar festivals** — Where populations could not be exterminated, the strategy was to **overwrite**
   their solar observances with Catholic feast days: the Winter Solstice becomes Christmas (Dec. 25); the Spring
   resurrection goddess (Ishtar/Ostara/Eostre) becomes Easter; the harvest festivals become All Saints/All Souls.
   The dates were kept; only the names were changed. The solar allegory was preserved in the holiday *structure*
   while its astronomical meaning was stripped away.

4. **The "Dies Natalis Solis Invicti"** — December 25 was the official Roman feast of the "Birthday of the
   Unconquered Sun" (*Sol Invictus*), celebrated since Aurelian's solar-cult reforms of 274 CE. The Catholic Church
   placed the birth of Christ on this exact date not by historical calculation but by theological confiscation.

5. **Silencing of contemporary witnesses** — Edward Gibbon in *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* (c. 1776) noted
   with evident irk that *no contemporary Roman or Greek chronicler* recorded the extraordinary events of the alleged
   Jesus story — despite the period being *"one of the best documented in history."* The absence of evidence is not
   explained by the events being small or private; it is explained by the events being allegorical, not historical.

## What the "Slave Religion" Actually Was

The Gnostic Christians that Catholicism supplanted understood the cosmic allegory. They were **not monotheists** in the
later Catholic sense — they recognized multiple divine principles, maintained esoteric astronomical knowledge, and
understood Christ as a principle (*logos*, light, reason) rather than a literal historical human being.

The redaction performed by the Jesuit-Catholic apparatus was therefore not the creation of a new religion but the
**inversion** of an existing one:

- The esoteric (inner, initiatory) knowledge of the solar allegory was stripped from the laity and reserved for the
  initiated clergy
- The solar cosmology was reframed as "paganism" and its practitioners as heretics
- The seasonal, observable, participatory worship of the sky was replaced with obedience to an invisible authority
  mediated through a hierarchical, Rome-centered institution
- Resistance was heresy; heresy was punishable by death

As Galileo was told by the Church in 1632, just before his sentencing: *"it would be necessary to forbid men to look at
the heavens."* *(Source: solarmythology.com/cosmology.htm)*

That is not the statement of a religion trying to find the truth. It is the statement of an information monopoly
defending its exclusive franchise.
