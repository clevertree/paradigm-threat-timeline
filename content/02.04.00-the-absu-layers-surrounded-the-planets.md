# The Absu layers surrounded the Planets

Visible on the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth was "[the Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php)", also called
"The Abyss" or [Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament) in the Christian Bible. This 'seal' represented multiple outer layers of Saturn's plasma sheath and appeared
to humans as obscuring equatorial rings of a cosmic 'sea' in the southern sky.
[Jno Cook](https://jnocook.net/) describes it:

> "I had no trouble identifying the Sumerian Absu, the Egyptian Duat,
> and the Maya House of Nine Bushes as a set of rings seen in the southern night sky.
> The rings were almost universally, throughout the world, understood to be an
> ocean standing up from the south horizon. By the Talbott / Thornhill model,
> Earth would have existed within the glow level plasma discharge (the coronal envelope)
> of Saturn before the intersection with the Solar System, and within the memory of mankind.
> The stars and other planets might not have been visible, and perhaps not even Saturn would have been seen
> — just the 'waters above'."

## What the Absu Actually Was

"Absu" is the **Mesopotamian word for the rings**; it translates as _Abyss_ — "the Deep." Earth possessed a system
of concentric equatorial plasma rings — analogous to Saturn's rings today — which formed during the period of the
polar configuration. From _[Chapter 12: Saturn and Archaeology](https://saturniancosmology.org/arch.php.html)_:

> _"'Absu' is the Mesopotamian word for the rings; it translates as Abyss — the Deep. People living in the northern
> hemisphere would have seen the rings in the southern skies at night... the rings would have stood some 40 or 50
> degrees up in the sky, below the semicircle which defines the equatorial, reaching in an arc from directly east
> to directly west... The rings would all meet at the east and west cardinal points of the horizon (bunching
> together). At night the Absu was brilliant and clearly seen because the rings would have been lighted directly
> by the Sun."_

These rings were not metaphorical. They were physically real structures — **Earth's own ring system** — present
within living memory of ancient peoples. They dominated the southern night sky, blotting out most stars below the
equatorial. During the daytime they merged with the sky and became invisible. **No rings were ever seen in the
northern skies.**

The rings predated 3147 BC and persisted until **2349 BC**, when they fell — the event recorded worldwide as
the **Flood of Noah**.

*During the Golden Age, the *Absu* plasma layers of [Proto-Saturn](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html) (also known as the [Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament) in the bible) surrounded the Planets.*

## Ring Count by Latitude — Why Cultures Disagree

The number of rings recorded varies by culture — not because they are describing different things, but because more
rings became visible the closer one was to the equator. From
_[Chapter 5: The Absu and Speculation](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php.html)_:

> _"The Sumerian Absu and the Egyptian Duat, seen at 30 degrees north latitude, consisted of 'seven seas'... while
> the Maya or Olmec, located at 20 degrees latitude, ten degrees further south, counted nine rings ('bushes'). In
> the USA, at Poverty Point, Louisiana, at 33 degrees north latitude, only six rings were recalled in a huge land
> sculpture."_

| Culture / Location | Latitude | Ring Count | Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sumer / Mesopotamia | ~32°N | 7 | Absu / "seven seas" |
| Egypt | ~30°N | 7 | Duat / "seven mansions" |
| Greece / Sicily | ~37°N | 6 | Scylla's six heads (Homer) |
| Poverty Point, Louisiana | 33°N | 6 | Six concentric earthwork berms |
| Maya / Olmec (Yucatan) | ~20°N | 9 | House of Nine Bushes |
| India | 10–30°N | 9 | Nine rivers / seven snakes |
| Nordic / Tibet / China / Siberia | high latitudes | 9 | Nine heavens / nine rivers |
| Cook Islands | 20°S | 9 | Nine heavens cosmological diagram |

The **Odyssey's** six-headed monster Scylla — living in a cave high on a mountain rising out of a "sea" — is
identified as a direct record of the six rings visible from Sicily (38°N latitude), matching the six earthwork rings
at Poverty Point at the same latitude.

## The Shadow Doorway — Gate of the Gods

Earth's shadow fell across the rings each night, creating a moving arched gap that ancient people called a
**doorway or gate**. The shadow moved from east to west across the rings from nightfall to dawn, and at the
equinoxes widened into a giant trapezoid gap:

> _"The Earth would have cast a shadow across the rings at night... Depending on the angle of the Sun, it would
> have looked like an obscured arched doorway, and at the equinoxes as a giant gap. I had no trouble locating
> references to a doorway of the Duat and to the Egyptian name for the door whose name implied that 'reeds did
> not grow there.' The land of the Gods and dead pharaohs was located in the sky in the west — the direction in
> which the portal moved each night."_
>
> — _[Chapter 5: The Absu and Speculation](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php.html)_, Saturnian Cosmology

The Mesoamerican **ballcourt** — two sloping parallel walls facing a central playing field — is a physical
architectural representation of this shadow gap as seen at the equinoxes.

The Egyptians depicted God Re (Jupiter) as a giant red globe sitting in a **mountain saddle between two ridged
peaks**, which also maps directly to the equinox shadow gap in the Duat. The massive pylons at later Egyptian
temples replicate the left and right edges of the Duat where Earth's shadow did not fall.

In Akkadian times (after 2335 BC), the invading Akkadians misread the name of an ancient Sumerian site as
**"The Gate of the Gods"** — Bab-ili, *Babylon* — confirming that the doorway through the Absu had been a
real, recognized feature of the sky. Babylon held its position as the supreme ceremonial center of Akkad and
Sumer for the following **2,000 years** because of this association.

The **U-shaped ceremonial centers** of the Andes likewise replicate the arched gap of the Absu's shadow portal.

## Cross-Cultural Names for the Absu

The rings were recorded under radically different names by cultures with no contact with one another:

| Tradition | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sumerian | Absu | "The Deep" / "The Abyss"; seven rings; God Enki assigned to this sky sector |
| Egyptian | Duat | "Seven mansions" / "seven qerert (circles)"; spoked rings like reeds in a swamp |
| Hebrew / Bible | Abyss / The Deep / Firmament | "The waters above the firmament" (Genesis 1:7) |
| Maya | House of Nine Bushes | Nine rings visible from Yucatan latitude |
| Olmec | Nine-ring sky | Consistent with Maya count at ~20°N |
| Indian | Nine rivers / seven snakes | Vedic memory of nine plasma ring bands |
| Greek | Sea surrounding the world / Oceanus | Ocean standing vertically in the southern sky |
| Norse | Nine Worlds / primordial waters | Ring layers as the multiple worlds of the cosmos |

In Egypt the Gods and dead pharaohs were described as **moving by boat across the Duat** — physically sailing
through the ring system. The mountain of Re (Jupiter's plasma plume) was said to **rise out of the waters** of the
Duat to illuminate its depths — consistent with Jupiter's lower plasma column descending through the ring plane.

## The Fall of the Absu — 2349 BC

The Absu did not fade gradually. It **collapsed catastrophically** in 2349 BC — the event encoded as the
**Flood of Noah** across hundreds of independent traditions worldwide. From
_[Chapter 30: The Maya Chilam Balam](https://saturniancosmology.org/chil.php.html)_:

> _"The Absu turned red, and lightning fired across the rings. The equatorial rings disappeared soon after, and
> the southern stars first showed. Most prominent was the appearance of the Pleiades, high in the sky in the south
> at midnight."_

> _"When the Absu collapsed, the Pleiades appeared for the first time — an event which continued to be used in the
> future as a signal for celebrations of the 'Day of the Dead' worldwide."_

The sequence of the Fall of the Absu:

1. Jupiter exits the Asteroid Belt and develops a massive lower plasma plume (~2500 BC)
2. Jupiter approaches Earth; its southern plasma mountain becomes visible
3. A gigantic lightning bolt (plasmoid) discharges from Jupiter — **the thunderbolt of the Gods**
4. Nine additional lesser plasmoid bolts follow
5. **The Absu turns red** — the rings heat up and electrify
6. Lightning fires across the ring bands
7. The rings **collapse and disperse** — raining down as water onto Earth, and drifting into space
8. For the first time, the **Pleiades and southern stars** become visible to northern hemisphere observers
9. The ecliptic and equatorial cross appear as a yellow road and a blood-red remnant ring
10. The Moon appears near Earth and settles into regular orbit

China records this event as "the waters stood above the mountains." The _Chilam Balam_ calls it the third creation.
Egyptian dynastic chronology marks it as the transition to the Third Dynasty, whose pharaohs begin adding "Re" to
their names.

## Archaeological Evidence

Physical structures worldwide were built to **commemorate or model the Absu**:

- **Poverty Point, Louisiana** (c. 1700–1100 BC) — Six concentric earthwork berms, matching the six rings visible at 33°N latitude
- **Naqada II Egyptian pottery** (3500–3200 BC) — Pots depicting 6–7 concentric ring areas
- **Cook Islands cosmological diagram** (19th century record) — Nine heavens above Earth, six underworld regions, matching nine-ring view from 20°S
- **Mesoamerican ballcourts** — Architectural model of the equinox shadow gap in the Absu
- **Egyptian temple pylons** — Replicate the left and right edges of the Duat at the shadow boundary
- **Andean U-shaped ceremonial centers** — Reflect the arched shadow doorway of the southern sky rings
- **Amphitheater form** — The standard semicircular assembly space universally replicates the arched southern ring-sea seen from the northern hemisphere
