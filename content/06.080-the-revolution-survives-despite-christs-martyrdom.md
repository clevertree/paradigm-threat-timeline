# The Revolution survives despite Christ's Martyrdom

But the real reason for the surviving of the Christian revolution was the successful Crusade that was waged in revenge
of the Crucifixion. Christ's brother returned home from Istanbul to Crimea with Christ's body and the Christian
congregation of smaller-sized humans followed. His influence began to rapidly spread.
The foundations were laid for a new republic in defiance of the religious authoritarianism practiced in
Istanbul. This new **Russian-Hordian** Empire would rapidly grow into a world empire until its disillusion in 1775.
After the fall, the memory of the founding of the Rus-Horde Empire would become *redacted* into other narratives
like the founding of Medina by Muhammad after his flight from Mecca, and many others.

The Deep State had a secondary motive in allowing Christ's brother to return alive to a homeland full of Giants. They
were hoping to trigger a revenge attack and route the giants into a trap. The tall walls of Jerusalem/Troy in Istanbul
were built specifically on the strategic Bophorus river to fend off Giants. If one wall were to fall, there were 2 more
within. If the Deep State could trigger a *crusade* against the walls of Jerusalem, they would be able to eliminate a
maximum number of Giants in a single event.
