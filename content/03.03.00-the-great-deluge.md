# The Great Deluge

As Earth and the other planets passed through Saturn's outer plasma sheath (The _Absu_), the layer cooled
into [sodium-salt water](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20090624.html)
becoming heavy and crashing into the planet surface causing the first **great deluge**
by [each civilization](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Great_Flood). Earth receives its salty oceans from
Saturn, which is why the Atlantic ocean is also called the [Sea of Kronos](https://atlantipedia.ie/samples/sea-of-kronos/).
In modern times, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cannot legitimately answer the question:
[Why is the ocean salty, but rivers flowing into it are not?](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/riversnotsalty.html)

> Many great deluges have taken place during the [thousands of]
> years since Athens and Atlantis were preeminent. Destruction
> by fire and other catastrophes was also common. In these
> floods, water rose from below, destroying city dwellers but not
> mountain people. The floods, especially the third great flood
> before Deucalion, washed away most of Athens' fertile soil.

> When the Sun Age came, there had passed 400 years. Then came 200 years, then 76. Then all mankind was lost and drowned
> and turned to fishes.
> The water and the sky drew near each other. In a single day all was lost, and Four Flower consumed all that there was
> of our flesh.
> The very mountains were swallowed up in the flood, and the waters remained, lying tranquil during fifty and two
> springs.
