# Priori-Mars as the Ladder / Stairway / Mountain of Heaven

[Annis Pepion Scott](https://www.electric-cosmos.org/ouruniverse.html) describes the _Cosmic Mountain_:

> Might the flowing hair of Venus, or the "fiery dragon" (as that
> planet is depicted in many ancient myths and drawings) actually
> have been the glowing ions of twisting Birkeland currents (or
> "stringy things" as mainstream astronomers call them)? Pictographs
> showing ladder formations and tales of a "Ladder to Heaven" or
> Jacob's Ladder might well be based on sightings of Birkeland
> currents and plasma instabilities such as those Peratt has seen in
> his plasma laboratories. It is interesting to note how often a
> sphere (planet?) is included in pictures of the Chinese dragon.


The hollow planet Mars was much larger than it is today, containing several more outer shells of decreasing density.
Each shell is supported by opposing magneto-spheres. During interplanetary encounters, the outer shell
of [Priori-Mars](http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/peek.aspx?id=7598)
collapsed, and the inner shell would exit the planet's outer surface leaving a long streaking cone shape behind it. The
inner shell would then approach Earth, sometimes causing cataclysm, before retreating and returning completely to its
spherical shape repeating until Priori-Mars finally loses its outer shell in 686 B.C.E. This *cosmic mountain* would
be remembered as the *Yggdrasil: The Tree of Life*, *The Tower of Babel*, *Ladder or Stairway to Heaven*, and many other
myths. The cone shape would appear in famous artifacts such as the Egyptian White Crown, the Persian Crown of Mithra.
