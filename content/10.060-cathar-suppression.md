# Cathar Suppression

Another persecuted group were the [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) whose religion was
based largely on Gnostic Christianity, specifically on the teachings of Christ's mother Katya (Katherine). The Cathars
had traveled West since the creation of the Rus-Horde Empire spreading its influence, but since the religious schism
began their teachings became wildly unpopular in Europe. Eventually they were charged with heresy for
denying the **Divinity of Christ and the Authority of the Pope** and many were burned at the stake.

The full annihilation of the Cathars by the Reformation-era Deep State is covered in the later article
[Cathars are annihilated in a reversed "Holy" Crusade & Inquisition](11.230-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md).
This article focuses on the identity and theology of the Cathars and the XVI century Inquisition machinery used
against them.

## The Name "Cathar" and the Katherine Connection

The word *Cathar* derives from Greek *katharoi* — "the pure ones." This is the same root as
*catharsis* (purging), *cauterize* (to burn clean), and *Catholic* (*katholikos* — universally translated as
"Holy Katherine"). The irony is deliberate and encoded: the institution that burned the Cathars called itself
by a name derived from the very root it was destroying.

The Cathars claimed spiritual descent from the teachings of **Katya (Katherine)**, understood in the NC
framework as Christ's mother — not Mary of the later sanitized canon, but the feminine principle of the
original unified XII–XV century Christianity. The post-schism Church stripped Katherine/Katya from the
doctrine, subordinated the feminine principle entirely to a male priesthood, and declared those who preserved
the older theology *heretics*.

The words we have inherited encode the memory of what was done: to *catharize* meant to **burn someone
for their Cathar faith**. The word entered common usage meaning "purging by fire," and has
never left it.

## Cathar Doctrine as Encrypted Old-Empire Theology

Cathar doctrine preserved the core structure of pre-schism unified Christianity in a form unacceptable to
the post-Reformation Church:

- **Dualism** — two principles (light and matter), directly reflecting the Gnostic framework of the original
  Eastern ascetic tradition rather than the Western sacramental system
- **Rejection of material sacraments** — no transubstantiation, no physical Eucharist; the *perfecti*
  (senior initiates) received direct spiritual transmission identical to Eastern hesychast practice
- **The *perfecti* class** — a celibate, wandering preacher caste structurally parallel to Orthodox
  monastic missionaries who had carried the original faith West during the Horde expansion
- **Denial of Christ's physical suffering on the cross** — not atheism but the original
  Docetist position: the divine could not be trapped in degraded matter; this matched the earliest
  pre-Nicene theology before the institutional incarnational narrative was imposed

In the NC model, the Cathars were not a sect that invented new ideas. They were the most conservative
remnant of the old faith — loyalists who refused the post-schism theological settlement imposed by Rome and
its Reformation successors. They were not *heretics* in any original sense. They were the *original* Christians.

## The Inquisition as a Horde Cleansing Operation

The mainstream narrative frames the Inquisition as religious persecution driven by superstition and power
politics. The NC framework frames it very differently.

According to Fomenko & Nosovskiy (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §38), the Inquisition was originally
**an imperial sanitation and social-order mechanism** of the Russia-Horde Empire. Western Europe in the
XIV–XV centuries had developed a degenerated Christian cult — the orgiastic "bacchanalian" church practices
that had spread infectious disease across the continent. The Horde Khan-Emperors, unable to treat epidemic
disease medically at that stage of development, made the decision to conduct military quarantine operations:

> *The Atamans (Ottomans) were ordered to annihilate the sick population of the infected regions. The
> segregation of the sick from the healthy is reflected in the Apocalypse as the division of the populace
> into the pure and impure, the righteous and sinners… The famous Inquisition was created for the purpose
> of 'cleansing'.* — [5v1], ch.12:9–10

The "pure" (*katharoi*) were those who had **not** participated in the orgiastic cult — ascetics, celibates,
wandering preachers. The Cathars, with their *perfecti* structure and strict sexual renunciation, were
**exactly this population**: the demonstrably clean, the ones who had kept the original ascetic faith.

The bitter irony of the later campaign against them is that the institutional Church, having adopted the name
*Catholic* (= Holy Katherine), then reversed the Inquisition machinery against the very people it was
originally designed to *protect* — turning it into a weapon of ideological suppression during the Reformation.

## The Book of Judges = The Epoch of the Inquisition

Fomenko & Nosovskiy identify the Old Testament **Book of Judges** as the encoded record of the XVI century
Inquisition in Western Europe (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.6 §31). The **Judges of Israel** are the
**Judges of the Inquisition**:

> *The Book of Judges perceives the Inquisition either sympathetically or neutrally, which corresponds very
> well with the point we are making… The Inquisition was a Horde and Ottoman organisation whose aim was to
> eradicate the social consequences of the epidemics which broke out in the provinces of the Empire.*
> — Ch.6 §31

Three storylines in the Book of Judges map directly to XVI century Inquisition cases in France:

| Biblical figure | French historical parallel | Event |
|---|---|---|
| **Deborah** the Prophetess | **Joan of Arc** | Burned at the stake in Rouen for "insubordination and heterodoxy" |
| **Abimelech** | **Simon de Montfort** | Led the crusade against the Cathars; Inquisition by fire and sword |
| **Samson** | **Gilles de Rais** | Burned in Nantes on charges of witchcraft and sorcery |

All three are Inquisition cases. All three are encoded in the same Biblical book. The NC dating places all
three in the XV–XVI century epoch of the Reformation — not the scattered canonical dates of 1209, 1431,
and 1440.

## Joan of Arc: A Cathar Burned at the Stake

> *It seems very likely Joan of Arc was one of the many Cathars "catharized" at the stake for their
> lingering faith in the old empire and gnostic religion.*

The case for Joan of Arc as a Cathar — or at minimum a representative of the old Gnostic faith — is
compelling when the evidence is read without the Scaligerian framing:

**1. The charges.** Joan was convicted of **"insubordination and heterodoxy"** — the exact charges brought
against Cathar *perfectae* (senior female initiates) across the campaigns of the Albigensian Crusade.
Heterodoxy is not sorcery; it is doctrinal deviance from the institutional norm. Joan's deviance was
theological, not magical.

**2. Direct revelation by "voices."** Joan's defining claim was that she received direct guidance from divine
voices (she named them Saints Catherine and Margaret). In Cathar theology — and in the original Eastern
mystical tradition — direct divine revelation without priestly mediation was foundational. It marked the
Cathar *perfecti* against the institutional church that required a priestly intermediary. Her voices were
specifically saints affiliated with the **Katherine** tradition.

**3. The NC dating.** In the New Chronology, Joan of Arc = the biblical prophetess **Deborah** of the Book
of Judges. The NC places Joan in the XV–XVI century Ottoman conquest epoch — squarely in the period when
the Reformation's reversed Inquisition was hunting down old-Empire faith remnants across Western Europe.
Her execution in Rouen, canonically dated 1431, is by NC chronological shift placed **~1580 CE** —
precisely the height of the post-Oprichnina suppression of Horde-loyalist traditions.

**4. Simon de Montfort's presence.** Fomenko & Nosovskiy explicitly connect **Abimelech** (Simon de
Montfort) — the Albigensian Crusade leader — to Joan's story via the **same Book of Judges** in which Joan
(Deborah) appears. They are the same episode, the same Inquisition campaign. See
[Jeanne D'Arc is Executed in Rouen, France](10.085-jeanne-darc-is-executed-in-rouen-france.md) for
the full NC analysis of Joan as Deborah.

**5. The name "Joan" itself.** *Jeanne* / *Johanna* = a feminized form echoing the Gnostic traditions
associated with **John** (the Beloved, the Gnostic Gospel writer). In Cathar tradition, the **Gospel of
John** — the most mystical, least institutional of the Gospels — was primary scripture. The other gospels
were considered lesser. A Cathar bearer of a *Johannine* name is not coincidental.

Joan burned at the stake. Gilles de Rais — her comrade, coded as the warrior Samson in the Judges — burned
at the stake. Both in France. Both Inquisition cases. Both in the epoch when the Albigensian Crusade's
machinery was still operating, hunting the last adherents of the old faith. The pattern is not random.

## What Was Lost

The systematic burning of the Cathars eliminated:

- The last institutional remnant of the **feminine principle** in Western Christianity
  (the Katya/Katherine theology)
- The **direct revelation** tradition (no priestly intermediary required)
- The **ascetic dualist** framework that had given original Christianity its clarity and rigour
- The **Gnostic Gospel tradition** (John as primary, material world as degraded)

What survived went underground, re-encoding itself into:

- **Devotion to Mary Magdalene** — the Gnostic feminine principle under a permissible name
- The **troubadour** and *fin'amor* tradition of Southern France — Cathar-adjacent cultural expression
- Various **chivalric secret societies** that preserved the dual-principle cosmology in symbolic form

The Deep State's Reformation successfully replaced all of this with institutional monotheism — a God without
a feminine counterpart, a Church without direct revelation, a faith without an interior life not mediated
by clergy. See
