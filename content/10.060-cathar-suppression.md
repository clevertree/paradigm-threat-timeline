# Cathar Suppression

Another persecuted group were the [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) whose religion was
based largely on Gnostic Christianity, specifically on the teachings of Christ's mother Katya (Katherine). The Cathars
had traveled West since the creation of the Rus-Horde Empire spreading its influence, but since the religious schism
began their teachings became wildly unpopular in Europe. Eventually they were charged with heresy for
denying the **Divinity of Christ and the Authority of the Pope** and many were burned at the stake.

> The struggle of the Reformation of the XVI-XVII cc. with the splinters of the Horde Empire is very well illustrated by
> the annihilation of the Cathars in France. The history of the Cathars is one of the most breathtaking and mysterious
> chapters of the Middle Ages. It is thought that the religion of the Cathars was Christian [6.2], ch.1.However, it
> differs from the Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism of today in its details. It was declared to be heretical.
