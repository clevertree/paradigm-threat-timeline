# Introduction

![Tartarian Empire: A Global Civilization](/media/00.overview/tartarian_structures_illustrated.jpg)
*This is evidence of a world-empire. The Rus-Horde 'Tartarian' Empire ruled over all continents between 12th and 18th centuries before its breakup in 1775.*

Questioning the 'official' timeline of Earth's history is not a new phenomenon.
Since the 16th century historian critics like
[Jean Hardouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hardouin),
[Robert Baldauf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baldauf),
[Edwin Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Johnson_\(historian\)),
[Wilhelm Kammeyer](http://alternative.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Chronology),
[Heribert Illig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis), and
[Immanuel Velikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky)
have accused church chronologists of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire)
such as [Joseph Scaliger](https://chronologia.org/en/old_books/scaliger_petavius_about.html)
(founder of [modern chronology](https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/joseph-justus-scaliger/))
of conspiring to obfuscate historical records before the 13th century C.E. In modern times, state-sponsored historians
like [Anatoly Fomenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Fomenko#Historical_revisionism)
have used [statistical analysis](https://chronologia.org/en/math_impressions/index.html) of published records
from 2200
sources including [Scaliger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger),
[House of Romanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Romanov),
[The Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament)
& [OT Apocrypha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha),
[Quran](https://quran.com/en),
[Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng),
[Maya-Kiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples),
[etc.](https://chronologia.org/en/shakespeare/foreword.html)
His team revealed **duplicated** matching chronology spanning periods of hundreds or thousands of years, often with the
names and locations changed. In his [New Chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_chronology_\(Fomenko\)),
modern human history started less than a thousand years ago:

> **Christ** was born in [The Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_chronology_\(Fomenko\)#Fomenko's_claims) on
> December 25th, 1152 A.D. and was crucified on Joshua's Hill in **Constantinople/Istanbul**.
> The Trojan War and the Crusades were waged in revenge of the Crucifixion and were
> in reality the [same historical event](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03.html).
> Genghis Khan and the Mongols were actually Russians.
> The lands west of the 13 colonies that now constitute the American West and Middle West
> were a far eastern part of Siberian-American ([Rus-Horde](https://en.topwar.ru/92613-russko-ordynskaya-imperiya.html))
> Empire prior to its disintegration in 1775.

![Earth may have been a satellite of planet Saturn in primordial times](/media/00.overview/saturnian-cosmology-symbols.png)

In 1952, [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky) posited that 'ancient' history was
also in need of a [major revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_in_Chaos). He used
[comparative mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_mythology) and ancient literary sources
(especially the Old Testament) to argue that Earth suffered catastrophic close contacts with other planets
(Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, and especially Venus and Mars) in our past. In 1997,
[Wal Thornhill](https://www.velikovsky.info/wal-thornhill/) presented the
[Electric Universe](https://www.electricuniverse.info/)
theory which provided a new foundation in interplanetary physics that neatly explained why these cataclysms occurred
in the past. In [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html), Earth's recorded history is **less than 4 thousand years** since the start
of the [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age#Other_Golden_Ages).

# Project Objective

![Fomenko books - USA has Issues with British Maps](/media/00.overview/fomenko_books.jpg)
*[USA has Issues](https://www.amazon.com/Issues-British-Maps-century-History-ebook/dp/B013B019Z0) with British Maps of 18th-century analyses in detail the maps of the 1771 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica and concludes that the Northwestern part of the United States of America was built on remains of Moscuvite Tartary.*

The objective of this timeline is to compile an [alternate history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history)
of Earth based on [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.everythingselectric.com/wallace-thornhill/)
and [Fomenko's *New Chronology*](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/index.html)
into an accessible sequence of events from the first memory to modern day. As new research comes to light, I plan on
making corrections to this timeline. I'm hoping this project helps others navigate the _dissonance of consensus_, and be
able to access the *unredacted* origin story of our planet and our species. This timeline focuses on the *causality*
between major events (i.e. why one event led to the next), so not all events of world history are listed.
