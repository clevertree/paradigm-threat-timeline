# Gregorian Calendar makes slight adjustment to length of a year

Since the end of the Dark Ages, the Earth's orbit around the Sun had slowed from 365.25 days in the 11th Century to
365.2425 days towards the end of the 16th Century. Protestants used this as an excuse to introduce the *Gregorian*
calendar in defiance of the Rus-Horde's [Lunisolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar) calendar. 13
months of 28 days (with leap months) changed to 12 months of uneven day counts. Months were renamed from *natural*
events, for examples: Feb5th-'Beginning of spring', Feb19th-Rain Water,
Apr5th-[Pure Brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival) into names from the false history of the
Roman Empire, for examples: January named after Janus, a war god that didn't
even [appear](https://www.andersonlock.com/blog/god-doors/) in the Greek Pantheon, March named after another God of
War-Mars, July named after Julius Caesar who is
a [redaction](https://catholicfundamentalism.com/similarities-between-julius-caesar-and-jesus-christ/22546) of Christ,
and August named after Augustus Caesar who was *also* a reflection of Christ. Most significantly, the Jesuits moved the Birthday of Christ 1053 years into the past to *zero year*.
