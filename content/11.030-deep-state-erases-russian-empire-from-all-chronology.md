# Deep State erases Russian Empire from all chronology

In an attempt to control the shards of the fractured Empire, the Deep State removed the Rus-Horde from *all history*.
To accomplish this, the chronology compiled by [Joseph Scaliger](http://scihi.org/scaliger-history/history/chronology/) was heavily
redacted, reorganized, and mass-redistributed by
Jesuit [Dionysius Petavius](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100319742)
in the [Opus De Doctrina Temporum](https://books.google.com/books?id=NYhEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover)
(1627). Fomenko [writes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html):

> Scaligerian chronology is being created making the dates of a great number of events artificially older.

## Languages Invented to Erase the Empire

Language itself was weaponized in the 17th century campaign to destroy the memory of the Hordian Empire. According to the New Chronology, the modern national languages of Western Europe — French, German, Spanish, English — were not ancient vernaculars that slowly evolved. They were *constructed* within a single generation's time from Church-Slavonic roots, with deliberate modifications to create barriers between the new nations and the Imperial center. The goal was simple: if the populations of France, Germany, and Spain could no longer read the old Imperial records written in Church-Slavonic, those records ceased to exist as public memory.

New crowns appeared throughout Western Europe in the 17th century, each claiming "ancient origins." France, Germany, Italy, England, and the rest all invented genealogies reaching back into fabricated antiquity — a genealogy that Scaliger's chronology was engineered to support. The [Index of Forbidden Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum) was the institutional mechanism for purging the old library. Old Imperial texts were burned, copied over, or simply locked away. ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §13](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html))

## Destruction of the Archangel Cathedral

The physical destruction of the Hordian record extended to the most sacred sites. In Moscow's Cathedral of the Archangel — the official burial site of the Russian dynasty — the Romanovs carried out a systematic erasure. Old tomb slabs were bricked over and re-plastered. New frescoes were painted over the original ones. The Romanovs created a **fake Royal necropolis** by relabeling existing graves, including the conversion of nun tombstones into "Czar burials." The entire burial record of the Hordian dynasty was reconstructed from scratch in the 1630s.

The most telling piece of evidence: the burial *type itself* changed in Russia between 1632 and 1636. Prior to this transition, the Russian-Horde czars were interred using entirely different rites — rites consistent with those found in the Egyptian Imperial cemetery that Western archaeologists would later call "Pharaonic." ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §14](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html))

## Arabic on Russian Weapons

Among the most striking physical evidence that the Romanov rewrite is relatively recent is the Kremlin Armoury Chamber. As late as the mid-17th century, Russian weapons were decorated with **Arabic inscriptions** — including the famous "Jericho Cap" (helmet) of Czar Mikhail, engraved with Quranic verses in Arabic. Paul of Aleppo, an Orthodox Christian traveler, wrote Russian texts in Arabic letters as late as 1656. The medieval traveler Afanasy Nikitin recorded his prayers in a mixture of Arabic and Turkic. Russian coins of the Imperial period were **bilingual** — bearing the name of the Khan on one side and the Grand Prince on the other, because Khan and Grand Prince were the same person described in two languages at once.

All of this dissolved after the Romanovs took power. The Arabic was stripped, the coins redesigned, the bilingual records reclassified as "Tatar occupation" artifacts. ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §8–10](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html))

## Foreign Occupation of Russian History

The scale of the rewrite is confirmed by examining who was allowed to write Russian history. When Peter I founded the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1724, **all** of its historians were foreign for the first eighteen years — Germans, Dutch, and Scandinavians brought in specifically to construct the "correct" version of the past. Out of thirty-four academics-historians between 1724 and 1841, only three were Russian. All the rest were foreign. These foreign scholars controlled which Russian documents were destroyed, which were rewritten, and which were preserved. Mikhail Lomonosov, the first Russian-born historian elected to the Academy, immediately recognized what was happening and began a fierce conflict with the foreign historians — a conflict he largely lost.
