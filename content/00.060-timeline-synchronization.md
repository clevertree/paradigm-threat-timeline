As a result of the
deliberate [destruction and obfuscation of indigenous culture worldwide](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-resistance-new-colonialism)
by the Holy Roman Empire and its predecessors, we have an array of conflicting dates for common events. Some examples of different dates of
*"Creation"* are:

- **5969 B.C.** — Antiochian by [Theophilus](https://biblehub.com/library/theophilus/theophilus_to_autolycus/chapter_xxiv_chronology_from_adam.htm) (*To Autolycus* III)

## Why the Dates Diverge: Conquest, Redaction, and the War Over Year Zero

The ~3,900-year spread between the oldest and youngest creation dates above is not evidence that different civilizations observed incompatible realities. It is evidence that **whoever controlled the written record controlled the calendar** — and controlling the calendar meant controlling how many years stood between your people and the moment God made the world.

This was not a subtle matter. The number of years since Creation determined:

- **Political legitimacy** — the civilization with the oldest history had the deepest roots, the longest covenant, the strongest claim to divine mandate.
- **Prophetic authority** — many traditions placed the end of the current age at a fixed number of years after Creation; the party that set year one controlled when the clock ran out.
- **Colonial erasure** — after conquest, the calendar of the conquered was typically the first thing replaced. A new year-zero was imposed, collapsing or overwriting the prior chronology.

### The Septuagint vs. Masoretic Text: A 1,500-Year Manufactured Gap

The ~1,500-year chasm between the **5500 B.C. cluster** (Greek Byzantine, Alexandrian, Roman Church fathers) and the **4000 B.C. cluster** (Hebrew, Protestant) is almost entirely explained by a textual dispute, not by different cosmological traditions.

The [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) (the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures, c. 280 B.C.) uses substantially longer lifespans in the genealogies of Genesis than the Hebrew [Masoretic Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text) (finalized by Jewish scholars c. AD 1000). The Greek church fathers — Hippolytus, Africanus, Theophilus, the Byzantine compilers — worked from the Septuagint and arrived at ~5500 B.C. Jewish and later Protestant chronologists worked from the Masoretic Text and arrived at ~4000 B.C.

Both texts were politically managed. The Septuagint was produced under Ptolemaic patronage for an Alexandrian library built to demonstrate Hellenistic intellectual supremacy. The Masoretic Text was finalized centuries after the destruction of Jerusalem, under conditions of dispersal and intense pressure to consolidate Jewish identity against Christian supersessionism. Each revision served the needs of its moment.

Neither version is a neutral transmission. **The 1,500-year gap between them is a textual artifact of competing empires, not a historical measurement.**

### What the Conquerors Burned

Redaction was not merely textual. The physical record was destroyed repeatedly:

- **Bishop Diego de Landa, 1562** — burned virtually all surviving Maya codices at Maní, Yucatán. Of hundreds of books documenting thousands of years of astronomical observation and calendar history, only four survived. Landa himself later wrote a partial account from memory, admitting the books contained "nothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil." The Maya calendar — which recorded the precise date of the World Flood at [3147 B.C.](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php) — was systematically replaced with the Christian calendar.
- **The Library of Alexandria** — burned in multiple incidents (Julius Caesar 48 B.C., Theophilus AD 391, Arab conquest AD 642). Whatever pre-Ptolemaic Egyptian chronology, Babylonian astronomical tablets, or indigenous African records it held are gone.
- **Nineveh, 621 B.C.** — the library of Assurbanipal burned when Nineveh fell to the Medes, Persians, and Chaldeans. [According to Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/hist.php), the Babylonian astronomical records from before 747 B.C. were largely discarded at an early date as "unreliable" — i.e., they described a sky that no longer matched contemporary observations, because the catastrophes of 747–685 B.C. had changed the length of the year, the position of the equinox, and the orbital period of the Moon.
- **Aztec codices** — systematically burned by the Spanish after the fall of Tenochtitlán (1521). The few surviving pictorial manuscripts were reinterpreted through a Christian lens by colonial friars who explicitly stated their goal was to demonstrate that Aztec cosmology was a corruption of Biblical truth.

In every case, the destruction was followed by a **rewriting of history from a new year zero** — one that placed the conqueror's theology at the origin of time.

## The Original Dates Were Likely Much Closer Together

Once the mechanisms above are removed — manufactured genealogical inflation, deliberate destruction of primary records, colonial imposition of new calendars — the surviving creation dates cluster into a much tighter range than the surface spread suggests.

Notice the structure of the dates above. They fall into two groups:

| Cluster | Dates | Source tradition |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **~5500–5969 B.C.** | Septuagint-based Christian chronologies | Greek, Byzantine, Alexandrian — all derived from inflated genealogies |
| **~3100–4100 B.C.** | Maya, Hindu, Jewish, Egyptian | Indigenous or pre-Hellenistic traditions |

The first cluster is almost entirely produced by a single textual manipulation: the addition of ~1,400–1,900 extra years to the patriarchal genealogies in the Greek translation. Strip that inflation out, and the cluster collapses toward the second.

The second cluster — ranging from ~4077 B.C. (Quiche Maya / Jno Cook) to ~3102 B.C. (Hindu Kali Yuga) to ~3147 B.C. (Olmec Long Count corrected) — spans only about 975 years. Given that:

1. These dates were recorded by civilizations separated by oceans with no documented contact
2. All describe the same type of catastrophic, world-ending / world-beginning event
3. They fall in a range that corresponds exactly to the final phase of the Saturnian polar configuration (from [4077 B.C. when Saturn went nova](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php) through [3147 B.C. when the configuration collapsed and the World Flood occurred](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php))

...the convergence is remarkable. The remaining spread within the second cluster is not noise — it is signal. Each date marks a *different event within the same extended process.*

## Creation Was a Process, Not a Moment

The most important reframe is this: **every civilization that recorded a creation date was recording a different chapter of the same story.**

[Jno Cook's reconstruction](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php) of Saturnian Cosmology — drawing on Mesoamerican, Mesopotamian, Indian, Egyptian, Chinese, and indigenous sources simultaneously — identifies a continuous sequence of cosmic events spanning roughly 8,000 years. Crucially, different civilizations established their year-zero at different chapters of this sequence:

| Event | Date | Who counted from this |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| Ball plasmoids extinguish in south sky — "first creation" ends | **8347 B.C.** | Mesoamerican first-era accounts (*Popol Vuh* references) |
| Saturn drops its coma, goes nova — the sun "first shows itself" | **4077 B.C.** | Quiche Maya (Jno Cook's baseline) |
| World Flood: polar configuration collapses, Saturn departs | **3147 B.C.** | Maya Long Count (3114 B.C. by later retrocalculation with 365.24-day year); Sumerian tradition assigns the flood story here |
| Fall of the Absu (Earth's equatorial rings): "flood of Noah" | **2349 B.C.** | Biblical / Babylonian tradition; "many nations also date the start of all sensible history and their calendars from this event" ([Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php)) |
| Moon enters regular orbit; legendary emperors Yao and Shun visible | **c. 2280 B.C.** | Chinese imperial chronology; Hindu Kali Yuga (~3102 B.C.) may also reference the period when the Moon first appeared predictably |
| End of Mars-Earth conflicts; skies go quiet | **685 B.C.** | "The start of history, science, and philosophy" ([Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/hist.php)) |

> *"In 4077 BC Saturn dropped its coma. This had been the 'chaos before creation' which had lasted some 7000 years. It had obscured Saturn and its companion satellites. Saturn went nova... and Saturn lit up more brilliantly than the Sun. To the humans of Earth, who had not clearly seen the real Sun for thousands of years... this was the start of creation, the start of time."*
> — Jno Cook, [A Synopsis](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php)

A civilization that remembered the World Flood (3147 B.C.) as the primal catastrophe counted backward from there to establish year one. A civilization that remembered the Saturn nova (4077 B.C.) as the first light counted from there. A civilization whose records were filtered through the Flood of Noah tradition (2349 B.C.) established *that* event as the new beginning.

The Jewish calendar's 3761 B.C. falls almost exactly between the Saturn nova (4077 B.C.) and the World Flood (3147 B.C.) — consistent with a genealogical count that began somewhere in the late polar configuration era, before the Flood, and was later compressed by post-exilic scribes working from memory and theological convention.

The Hindu Kali Yuga of 3102 B.C. falls within 45 years of the Maya date of 3147 B.C. (corrected). Both mark the end of the Golden Age — the collapse of the divine order — though the Hindu tradition counts forward from a preceding epoch not captured in a single creation date.

### Every "Creation" Description Fits the Same Sky

What makes the convergence undeniable is that creation myths worldwide describe the *same observable phenomena*:

- A **great darkness** before creation (the plasmasphere coma of Saturn obscuring the Sun for thousands of years)
- A **sudden light** or divine fire appearing in the north sky (Saturn going nova, 4077 B.C.)
- A **central tree, pillar, or axis of the world** running through the sky (the polar plasma column connecting Earth to Saturn's configuration)
- A **flood** that destroyed the prior world (the World Flood of 3147 B.C., or the Absu collapse of 2349 B.C., or both — conflated in most traditions)
- A **new sky** after the catastrophe (the modern solar system, post-685 B.C.)

These are not metaphors. [Jno Cook documents](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php) these observations in sources from Mesoamerica, Mesopotamia, India, China, Egypt, Greece, Australia, and Polynesia — all independently describing the same configuration. The difference between a 4077 B.C. creation date and a 3147 B.C. creation date is not a contradiction. It is a debate over which catastrophe deserves to be called *the beginning.*

The thousands of years of apparent disagreement collapse once you understand that **the conquerors added years to push the origin further back, destroyed records that preserved the original dates, and imposed new calendars that severed living peoples from their own chronology.**
