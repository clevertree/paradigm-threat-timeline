**American** | **Civil engineering, independent cosmology**

Ralph E. Juergens (1924–1979) originated the Electric Sun hypothesis — the foundational claim that the Sun is powered by external cosmic electric discharge rather than internal thermonuclear fusion. A civil engineer by training (Case Western Reserve), he became an editor at McGraw-Hill, then associate editor of *Pensée* and senior editor of *Kronos*. He co-founded FOSMOS (Foundation for Studies of Modern Science) in 1968 with de Grazia and Stecchini, and co-authored *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966), documenting the institutional suppression of Velikovsky. His 1972 *Pensée* paper first proposed the Sun as the focus of a cosmic electric discharge — the theoretical cornerstone on which Thornhill's entire Electric Universe was built. He died November 2, 1979, of officially unknown causes, two months after publishing his most mature Electric Sun papers. In 2007, Wikipedia deleted his entry, erasing the primary public record of the originator of one of the most significant heterodox cosmological frameworks of the 20th century.

**Key Works:** *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966, with de Grazia and Stecchini); Electric Sun papers in *Pensée* and *Kronos* (1972–1979)
