# Michael Cremo (b. 1948)

**American (Bhaktivedanta Institute)** | **Independent research, Vedic cosmology, forbidden archaeology**

Cremo co-authored with Richard L. Thompson the 900-page *Forbidden Archaeology* (1993), systematically documenting hundreds of suppressed cases where modern human skeletal remains or artifacts were found in geological strata dated to millions of years ago — cases quietly discarded rather than addressed by the mainstream literature. He argued that scientific institutions apply a "knowledge filter," systematically excluding evidence contradicting the established human evolution timeline. He connected this archaeological evidence to Vedic cosmological accounts of cyclical human civilizations and argued for devolution rather than evolution. If even a fraction of his suppressed cases are valid, the human species is far older than the 200,000-year consensus — with direct implications for every chronological framework in this timeline.

**Key Works:** *Forbidden Archaeology* (1993, with Thompson); *Human Devolution* (2003)

## Does Both

Cremo **challenges the timeline** (extreme human antiquity from archaeology) and **interprets ancient texts as historical reality** (Vedic texts as real cosmic history):
