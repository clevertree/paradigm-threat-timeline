# Immanuel Velikovsky (1895–1979)

**Russian-Jewish, later American** | **Psychiatry, comparative mythology, ancient history, catastrophism**

Velikovsky argued that Venus was ejected from Jupiter as a comet within human memory, making multiple near-passes to Earth that caused the plagues of Exodus and Joshua's sun standing still, before settling into its present orbit. His *Ages in Chaos* (1952) proposed Egyptian chronology was mismatched with biblical history by ~500 years. Ancient myths, he insisted, are literal eyewitness records of celestial events. His work was suppressed with organized ferocity — an academic boycott forced his publisher to transfer *Worlds in Collision*, and Carl Sagan led a widely criticized campaign against him at the 1974 AAAS. Velikovsky was a pioneer but not the final word: his insistence on preserving Scaligerian chronology was a limitation the Saturnian Cosmology framework (Talbott, Cook, Thornhill) later transcended.

**Key Works:** *Worlds in Collision* (1950); *Ages in Chaos* (1952); *Earth in Upheaval* (1955)
