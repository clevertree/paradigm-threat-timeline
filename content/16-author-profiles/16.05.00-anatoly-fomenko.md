**Russian** | **Mathematics, topology, statistics, historical chronology**

Fomenko is a full professor at Moscow State University, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and a leading topologist who turned statistical analysis toward historical records beginning in 1973. Analyzing over 2,200 sources, he discovered systematic misdating throughout conventional history — identifying three major chronological shifts of approximately 333, 1,053, and 1,800 years embedded in Scaligerian chronology. His New Chronology argues that all "ancient" Greek, Roman, and Egyptian civilization is actually medieval (no earlier than ~900 CE), and that the historical Christ was born December 25, 1152 CE in the Crimea and crucified outside Constantinople in 1185 CE. His seven-volume work provides the backbone chronological framework for this timeline's medieval and post-medieval sections.

## Does Both

Fomenko both **challenges chronology** (his primary work) and **interprets ancient texts as encoding real historical events** (the Bible, Greek myth, and Roman chronicles are all interpretations of medieval events):
