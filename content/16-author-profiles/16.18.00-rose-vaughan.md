# Lynn Rose & Raymond Vaughan

**Lynn Rose:** Philosopher, SUNY Buffalo | **Raymond Vaughan:** Mathematician

**Fields:** Philosophy, mathematics, Babylonian astronomical analysis

Rose and Vaughan provided the mathematical proof from Babylonian astronomical records that Venus's orbit was recently disturbed, and derived the specific 685 BCE orbital stabilization date used throughout this timeline. Their 1974–1980 series of papers analyzing the Venus Tablets of Ammizaduga showed that normalizing the tablet data against present orbital parameters reveals a systematic residual consistent with a recent orbital disturbance — with Venus reaching its current configuration around 685 BCE, after which Babylonian records match present behavior. Cook explicitly credits them as providing the most rigorous astronomical analysis in the Velikovskian literature; their 685 BCE date is the primary anchor for this timeline's close of the Dark Ages chapter.

**Key Works:** "Venus Tablets and Sizes of Synodic Periods" (*Kronos*, 1974); papers in *Pensée* and *Kronos* (1972–1980)
