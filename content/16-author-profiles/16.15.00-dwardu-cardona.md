# Dwardu Cardona (1937–2018)

**Maltese-Canadian** | **Independent research, comparative mythology, Saturnian cosmology**

Cardona produced the most detailed mythological reconstruction of the Saturnian polar configuration, particularly the pre-configuration "God Star" era. Working closely with Talbott and contributing extensively to *Kronos* and *AEON*, he spent decades developing the mytho-historical evidence through six volumes tracing the sequence from Saturn as a lone "sun" through the polar configuration to catastrophic dispersal. His linguistic analysis traced "Saturn" and cognates across dozens of ancient cultures to a single referent, and his proto-Saturnian epoch argument — that Saturn shone alone before entering the solar system — provides the deep pre-history that Cook's chronology begins from.

**Key Works:** *God Star* (2006); *Flare Star* (2007); *Primordial Star* (2009); *Birth of the Gods* (2010); *Vishnu Born of the Sun* (2014); *Saturn-Myth Revisited* (2018)
