# Martinus van der Sluijs

**Dutch** | **Independent research, plasma mythology, comparative mythology**

Van der Sluijs systematically documented plasma discharge phenomena in ancient literary and mythological sources worldwide, extending Peratt's petroglyph work into written texts. He cataloged cross-cultural descriptions of the "world column," "cosmic axis," and "pillar of heaven" as records of Birkeland current aurora events during the polar configuration, argued that dragon myths encode specific plasma instability shapes (kink instabilities, Z-pinch nodes), and compiled ancient descriptions of unusual celestial phenomena mapped against known plasma discharge geometries. The same plasma column forms documented in rock art on every continent also appear in Mesopotamian, Indian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican written sources.
