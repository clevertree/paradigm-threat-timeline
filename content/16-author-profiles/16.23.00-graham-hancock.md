# Graham Hancock (b. 1950)

**British** | **Investigative journalism, prehistoric archaeology, alternative history**

Hancock assembled evidence for a lost advanced civilization destroyed by the Younger Dryas impact event (~10,900 BCE), whose survivors seeded the apparently "sudden" emergence of agriculture and monumental architecture worldwide. He argued that Göbekli Tepe (~9600 BCE) requires a civilizational substrate conventional prehistory cannot account for, that the Younger Dryas was caused by a fragmenting comet (the Taurid Complex per Clube & Napier), and that astronomical alignments and precessional cycles encoded in monuments preserve knowledge of this pre-catastrophe civilization. He documented submerged structures off India, Japan, and the Mediterranean dated before post-glacial sea-level rise, and argued Plato's Atlantis preserves genuine historical memory.

## Does Both

Hancock **challenges the timeline** (human civilization 10,000+ years older than accepted) and **interprets ancient sources as literal records** (Plato's Atlantis, global flood myths):
