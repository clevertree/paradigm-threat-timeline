# Robert Schoch (b. 1959)

**American** | **Geology, stratigraphy, geomorphology, archaeoastronomy**

Schoch is an associate professor of natural science at Boston University whose geological re-dating of the Great Sphinx to at least 7,000–10,000 BCE — based on water erosion patterns consistent with prolonged heavy rainfall — challenged the conventional ~2500 BCE construction date from within academic geology. The vertical undulating erosion channels in the Sphinx enclosure match thousands of years of heavy rainfall, not wind or the brief rains of the last 4,000 years. In later work (*Forgotten Civilization*, 2012), he argued that a massive solar plasma outburst around 9,700 BCE ended the last ice age catastrophically and destroyed an earlier advanced civilization, connecting directly to the EU catastrophist framework.

## Does Both

Schoch **challenges chronology** (re-dates the Sphinx geologically) and **interprets evidence as world cataclysm** (solar plasma destroyed earlier civilization):
