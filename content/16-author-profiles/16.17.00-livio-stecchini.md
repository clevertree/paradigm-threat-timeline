# Livio Stecchini (1913–1979)

**Italian-American** | **History of science, metrology, ancient astronomy**

Stecchini demonstrated that ancient Babylonian astronomical records encode orbital parameters inconsistent with present planetary motions, and that ancient measurement systems encode geodetic knowledge far exceeding what the conventional timeline assigns to those cultures. His Venus period analysis ("The Twenty-One Years of Venus") established that Babylonian Venus records encode orbital eccentricities inconsistent with Venus's current orbit, directly supporting Velikovsky's displaced-orbit claim. His metrological work showed that the Egyptian cubit encodes the Earth's polar and equatorial radius with sub-percent accuracy. He co-authored *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966) with de Grazia and Juergens, one of the earliest documented cases of institutional science censorship. Cook cites Stecchini extensively on plasma plumes in ancient records.

**Key Works:** *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966, with de Grazia and Juergens); Venus period papers in *Pensée* (1972–1973)
