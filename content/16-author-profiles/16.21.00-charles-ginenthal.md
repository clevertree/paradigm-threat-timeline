# Charles Ginenthal

**American** | **Independent research, editor**

Ginenthal produced the most sustained published defense of Velikovsky against institutional dismissal and conducted independent paleoclimatological research on mammoth extinction. His *Carl Sagan and Immanuel Velikovsky* (1995) is a point-by-point rebuttal demonstrating that Sagan repeatedly misrepresented Velikovsky's claims and used rhetorical rather than scientific criteria — the definitive response to the presentation considered the "closing argument" that ended Velikovskian respectability. His *Extinction of the Mammoth* (1997) argued mammoths were killed by catastrophic polar axis displacement, not gradual glacial retreat. As editor of *The Velikovskian* journal, he maintained a continuing venue for catastrophist scholarship through the 1990s and 2000s. Cook uses his Arctic climate estimates in the chronological reconstruction.
