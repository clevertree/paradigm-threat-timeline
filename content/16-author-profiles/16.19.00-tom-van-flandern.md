# Tom Van Flandern (1940–2009)

**American** | **Astronomy, celestial mechanics**

Van Flandern was an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory who proposed the Exploded Planet Hypothesis: the asteroid belt and comets originate from a planet that exploded within the solar system, and Mars is a former moon of that planet. He argued that asteroids have too many distinct mineralogical types for a single-source model, that short-period comets cannot have survived 4.5 billion years in the Oort Cloud, and that Mars's asymmetric cratering and trace atmosphere are consistent with a captured satellite. This framework provides the physical-astronomical underpinning for the Saturnian model's treatment of Mars as a body that participated in the polar configuration.
