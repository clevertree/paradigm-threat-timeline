**Giorgio de Santillana (1902–1974):** MIT historian of science | **Hertha von Dechend (1915–2001):** University of Frankfurt

**Fields:** History of science, comparative mythology, archaeoastronomy

Their 1969 *Hamlet's Mill* demonstrated that ancient myth encodes precise astronomical observation — specifically the precession of the equinoxes. The worldwide "mill" metaphor (Hamlet's mill, the Norse Grotti, the Hindu churning of the ocean) is a cross-cultural image for the precessing celestial pole, not a harvest metaphor or psychological archetype. By proving that myth reliably encodes real astronomical observation, *Hamlet's Mill* is the keystone work that legitimized reading ancient myth as literal celestial record — the methodological foundation on which Talbott's Saturn myth reconstruction and this entire timeline depend. Without de Santillana/von Dechend, the mythological evidence driving the earliest chapters could be dismissed as folklore.

**Key Works:** *Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth* (1969)
