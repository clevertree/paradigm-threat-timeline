**American** | **Plasma physics, archaeoastronomy**

Peratt is a plasma physicist from Los Alamos National Laboratory and student of Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén. He discovered that ancient petroglyphs worldwide depict patterns identical to those produced in laboratory high-current Z-pinch plasma discharge experiments — over 100 distinct petroglyph types on every inhabited continent mapping precisely to specific discharge phases. His 2003 paper identified three plasma columns in the ancient southern sky corresponding to the Saturnian lower configuration (squatting-man, columnar stacks, dot-in-circle motifs). The angle of incidence of petroglyph imagery relative to the horizon matches predictions for specific latitudes, confirming a common celestial source. This is the hardest physical evidence linking ancient rock art to actual plasma events.
