# Victor Clube & Bill Napier

**Victor Clube:** Oxford astrophysicist | **Bill Napier:** Armagh Observatory astronomer

**Fields:** Observational astronomy, cometary dynamics, cosmic catastrophism

Clube and Napier provided mainstream astronomical confirmation of catastrophic comet-swarm events within recorded human history. They argued that a giant comet (~50–100 km) entered the inner solar system within the last 20,000–30,000 years and fragmented progressively, producing the Taurid meteor stream. Periodic encounters with this debris produced catastrophic bombardment on cycles of centuries to millennia — the Bronze Age Collapse, Roman Dark Age, and early medieval dark horizon are all Taurid events, not social collapse. Their "coherent catastrophism" is notable because it reached catastrophist conclusions from within conventional astronomy using standard orbital mechanics, making it harder to dismiss on institutional grounds. Their Taurid Complex model is the astronomical mechanism behind Hancock's Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.
