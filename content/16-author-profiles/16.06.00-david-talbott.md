**American** | **Comparative mythology, independent research, catastrophism**

Talbott reconstructed the Golden Age polar configuration from comparative mythology. His 1980 *The Saturn Myth* argued that Saturn once occupied a fixed position at Earth's polar axis, appearing as an enormously enlarged stationary "sun" before a catastrophic reconfiguration dispersed the planets. He identified consistent cross-cultural archetypes — the Wheel of Heaven, the World Column, the Great Catastrophe — as independent records of the same sky, verified across 30+ unrelated ancient cultures. His polar configuration framework (Saturn → Venus → Mars aligned along a common polar axis) is the primary mythological scaffold for this entire timeline, with Cook providing specific calendar dates and Thornhill providing the plasma physics mechanism.

**Key Works:** *The Saturn Myth* (1980); *Thunderbolts of the Gods* (2005, with Thornhill); *The Electric Universe* (2007, with Thornhill)
