# Heribert Illig (b. 1947)

**German** | **Independent historical research, publishing**

Illig proposed the Phantom Time Hypothesis: 297 fabricated years (614–911 CE) inserted into the early medieval calendar. His 1991 *Das erfundene Mittelalter* argued that Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and Constantine VII collaborated around the year 1000 CE to insert their reign at the millennium by inventing "Charlemagne" and three centuries of history. No archaeological, astronomical, or architectural evidence unambiguously dates to the phantom period, and the Julian calendar's 13-day error by 1582 corresponds to ~1,000 years of drift rather than the expected ~1,200+. His work overlaps with Fomenko's New Chronology at the structural level — both identify a fabricated early medieval gap — though they reach it through different methods.

**Key Works:** *Das erfundene Mittelalter* (*The Invented Middle Ages*, 1991)
