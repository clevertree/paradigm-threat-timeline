# Gunnar Heinsohn (b. 1943)

**German** | **Sociology, independent history, stratigraphy**

Heinsohn argued from archaeological stratigraphy that the standard ancient timeline is chronologically inflated — the same physical strata assigned to multiple eras (Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, early medieval) are actually contemporaneous within a much shorter span. He identified "ghost empires" in the 1st millennium BCE that do not occupy distinct stratigraphic layers, argued that "Late Roman" and the "Migration Period" are the same catastrophic event, and pinpointed a global stratigraphic discontinuity around 930–940 CE corresponding to a major cosmic event that ended the Roman world. His work directly supports a compressed medieval-only timeline consistent with Fomenko.

## Does Both

Heinsohn both **challenges chronology** (stratigraphic evidence that ancient layers don't exist as claimed) and **interprets the physical record as world cataclysm** (the 10th century gap as catastrophic event):
