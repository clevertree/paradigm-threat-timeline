# Jesuits make "Pilgrimage" to Palestine

The Jesuits of Europe made 'pilgrimage' **through** Jerusalem #1 in Istanbul *walking past* the ruins and continuing
instead south to *Palestine* mistaking [Al Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) for the ruins of
both Jerusalem #1 in Turkey and #2 in Moscow. This was no accident-the mass published Protestant literature had
renamed and relocated all the ancient sites in an attempt to subsume the famous capitals of the vanishing Rus-Horde
Empire.

*Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatsoever, either orally or in writing.*
