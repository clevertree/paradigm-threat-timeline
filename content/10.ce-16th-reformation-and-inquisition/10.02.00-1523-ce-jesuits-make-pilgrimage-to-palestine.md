# Jesuits make "Pilgrimage" to Palestine

The Jesuits of Europe made 'pilgrimage' **through** Jerusalem #1 in Istanbul *walking past* the ruins and continuing
instead south to *Palestine* mistaking [Al Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) for the ruins of
both Jerusalem #1 in Turkey and #2 in Moscow. This was no accident — the mass-published Protestant literature had
renamed and relocated all the ancient sites in an attempt to subsume the famous capitals of the vanishing Rus-Horde
Empire.

*Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatsoever, either orally or in writing.*

## 16th Century: The Jesuit Expansion Meets the Protestant Counter-Offensive

The 16th century was the pivotal century for the Jesuit project — the period when the Society of Jesus (founded formally in 1534, see [Jesuit Operations: Conversion, Catholicism, and the New World](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.04.00-jesuit-operations-conversion-and-catholicism.md)) transformed from a small group of zealous missionaries into a global network spanning four continents. It was also the century when their most dangerous adversary emerged: not Islam, not indigenous resistance, but the [Protestant Reformation](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.01.00-1517-ce-protestant-reformation-begins.md).

### The Global Reach: Palestine, Africa, and Beyond

The Jesuit expansion of the 1500s targeted the three remaining non-Christian power centres:

**The Holy Land (1523).** Ignatius of Loyola's personal pilgrimage to Palestine in 1523 — before the Society was formally established — set the template. The pilgrims walked past the actual ruins of biblical sites in Turkey and were redirected to the Palestinian locations that Protestant cartographers had already begun relabelling. This geographical misdirection would become permanent: by the 19th century, the Jesuits themselves had institutionalized it as the [Jesuit Jerusalem Project](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.05.00-1814-ce-the-jesuit-restoration-and-the-missionary-military-pattern.md).

**Africa (1548).** The Jesuit expansion continued south to [Africa](https://www.creighton.edu/sites/default/files/2022-01/35-Africa.pdf), establishing colonies in an attempt to assimilate the indigenous religions of Ethiopia, Egypt, the Zambezi River region, Angola, and Cape Verde. The African missions proved more difficult than the American ones: the populations were larger, the Islamic presence was established and resistant, and the missionaries died of tropical diseases at appalling rates. But the Jesuits documented everything — Ethiopian Christianity (which they recognized as an ancient, non-Roman variant), local astronomical practices, agricultural systems, and trade networks — creating an intelligence archive that subsequent colonial powers would exploit for centuries.

**The Americas (deepening).** Building on the [initial 15th century penetration](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.04.00-jesuit-operations-conversion-and-catholicism.md), the 16th century saw the establishment of permanent Jesuit missions throughout Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and eventually Paraguay. The [Guaraní Reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_reduction) — autonomous indigenous communities under Jesuit governance — began in this period and would become the most ambitious social experiment in colonial history.

### The First Missionary Martyrdoms

The 16th century produced the first systematic wave of missionary deaths at the hands of indigenous communities. In Brazil, Jesuits were killed by [Tupinambá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupinamb%C3%A1_people) warriors who recognized the missionaries as advance agents of Portuguese colonization. In Florida, the [Jesuit missions of La Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_missions_in_Florida) ended in 1571 when a converted indigenous man named [Don Luís de Velasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Luis_de_Velasco_(Native_American)) led the killing of the entire missionary party — having spent years in Spanish custody and correctly identifying the Jesuits as the thin edge of the colonial wedge.

The pattern that would define the next four centuries was already visible: pleasant missionaries arrived first, built trust, were killed, and their deaths were used by the colonial powers as justification for military expeditions that had nothing to do with saving souls. The missionaries took the punishment for the sins of the empire. The empire took the continent.

### The Protestant Problem: Scaliger vs. Truth

The most consequential development of the 16th century for the Jesuit project was not in the Americas or Africa but in the lecture halls of Protestant Europe. [Joseph Justus Scaliger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger) (1540–1609) published *De Emendatione Temporum* (1583) and *Thesaurus Temporum* (1606), establishing the Scaligerian chronological framework that would become the accepted timeline of world history.

As documented in [Deep State erases Russian Empire from all chronology](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.04-1627-ce-deep-state-erases-russian-empire-from-all-chronology.md), Scaliger's chronology was not a scientific achievement — it was a political construction designed to legitimize Protestant power and delegitimize the Catholic-Orthodox-Hordian world order. Scaliger had no interest in the claims of indigenous peoples in the European colonies, no respect for the records of the Russian Empire his Protestant movement was protesting, and no commitment to mathematical or astronomical verification of his dates.

This is the fundamental distinction between the Jesuit and Protestant approaches to knowledge, and it matters enormously for the reconstruction of history:

- **The Jesuits wrote down accurately what they found**, even when it contradicted their own Catholic narrative. Their archives contain genuine observations of indigenous cultures, languages, astronomical knowledge, and historical claims — data that can be cross-referenced and verified.

- **The Protestants, led by Scaliger, fabricated what they needed.** They manufactured phantom centuries, invented ancient civilizations, and relocated historical events to suit a predetermined political narrative. They were not interested in math, science, physics, or truth. They were interested in winning a political and theological war against Rome and Moscow.

The Scaligerian chronology — the timeline taught in every school on Earth today — is therefore the *least reliable* historical framework available, because it was constructed by people who explicitly did not care whether it was accurate. The Jesuit documentation, despite its Catholic bias, is paradoxically *more reliable* because the Jesuits at least attempted to observe and record reality.
