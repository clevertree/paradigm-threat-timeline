# Cathar Suppression

The [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) practiced Gnostic Christianity based on Christ's mother Katya (Katherine). They spread West with the Rus-Horde Empire; after the religious schism, they were charged with heresy for denying the **Divinity of Christ and Authority of the Pope** and burned at the stake.

The full annihilation by the Reformation-era Deep State is covered in [Cathars annihilated](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.01-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md). This article covers Cathar identity and the XVI century Inquisition machinery.

## The Name "Cathar" and Katherine Connection

*Cathar* derives from Greek *katharoi* — "the pure ones" — same root as *catharsis*, *cauterize*, and *Catholic* (*katholikos* = "Holy Katherine"). The institution that burned Cathars bore a name derived from the root it was destroying. Cathars claimed descent from **Katya** — Christ's mother in the NC framework — stripped from post-schism doctrine. To *catharize* meant to **burn someone for Cathar faith**.

## Cathar Doctrine as Old-Empire Theology

Cathar doctrine preserved pre-schism unified Christianity in forms unacceptable to the post-Reformation Church: **Dualism** (light/matter); **rejection of material sacraments** (no transubstantiation — *perfecti* received direct spiritual transmission); **celibate wandering preachers** parallel to Orthodox missionaries; **denial of Christ's physical suffering** (original Docetist position: divine cannot be trapped in matter).

In NC, Cathars were not innovators — they were **the most conservative** remnant of the old faith. They were not heretics; they were the **original Christians**.

## The Inquisition as Reversed Horde Cleansing

The original Inquisition was an imperial sanitation mechanism (see [The Holy Inquisition](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.00-1542-ce-the-holy-inquisition.md)). The "pure" (*katharoi*) were those who had **not** participated in the orgiastic cult — ascetics, celibates, wandering preachers. The Cathars, with *perfecti* structure and strict sexual renunciation, were **exactly this population**.

The **Reversed Inquisition** turned this machinery against the very people it originally protected — using it for ideological suppression during the Reformation.

## Book of Judges = Epoch of the Inquisition

Fomenko & Nosovskiy identify the OT **Book of Judges** as the XVI century Inquisition's encoded record. Three storylines map directly:

| Book of Judges | French parallel | Event |
|---|---|---|
| **Deborah** | **Joan of Arc** | Burned at Rouen for "heterodoxy" |
| **Abimelech** | **Simon de Montfort** | Led crusade against Cathars |
| **Samson** | **Gilles de Rais** | Burned at Nantes on "witchcraft" |

All three are Inquisition cases; all appear in the same Biblical book; all placed in XV–XVI century Reformation epoch.

## Joan of Arc: A Cathar

The case for Joan as Cathar representative: (1) Convicted of **"heterodoxy"** — exact Cathar charges; (2) Direct revelation by "voices" (Saints Catherine and Margaret) — the Cathar *perfecta* model of unmediated divine contact; (3) NC dates Joan = **Deborah** of Judges, placed ~1580 CE during post-Oprichnina suppression; (4) The name *Jeanne* echoes Gnostic **Johannine** tradition — Gospel of John was primary Cathar scripture.

Joan and Gilles de Rais both burned in France. Both Inquisition cases. The pattern is consistent.

## What Was Lost

Systematic burning eliminated: the **feminine principle** (Katherine theology); **direct revelation** tradition; **ascetic dualist** framework; **Gnostic Gospel tradition**. What survived went underground — devotion to Mary Magdalene, troubadour tradition, chivalric secret societies.

See [Deep State redacts Christianity](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md) for how solar religion was abstracted into invisible Rome-mediated deity.
