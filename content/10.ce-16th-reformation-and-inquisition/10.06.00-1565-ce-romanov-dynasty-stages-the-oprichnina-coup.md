# The Oprichnina

The [Oprichnina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprichnina) (1564–1572) is conventionally described as a reign of terror ordered by Ivan the Terrible against the Russian boyar nobility. The New Chronology [inverts this picture](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html): the Oprichnina was not Ivan's doing. It was a *dynastic coup* staged by the Zakharyins-Romanovs — relatives of Ivan's first wife Anastasia — who seized Russia-Horde's government while the legitimate czar-khan was incapacitated, then used the state apparatus to annihilate their Hordian rivals.

*The actual authors of the Oprichnina were the Zakharyins-Romanovs, who ruled on behalf of an infant czar and used the apparatus to exterminate the Hordian military elite.*

## The Four Ivans

**"Ivan the Terrible" is not one man** but a composite of four czar-khans whose reigns were fused by Romanov historians:

| Czar | Reign (NC) | Key Fact |
|---|---|---|
| **Ivan IV Vasilyevich** | 1547–1553 | Conquered Kazan 1552; fell gravely ill 1553, became Vasiliy the Blessed (holy fool) |
| **Dmitry Ivanovich** | 1553–1563 | Infant son; ruled by council (*Izbrannaya Rada*); began the Livonian War |
| **Ivan V Ivanovich** | 1563–1572 | Young son; Zakharyins-Romanovs hold real power — the Oprichnina is unleashed |
| **Simeon-Ivan Beckbulatovitch** | 1572–1584 | Hordian Khan; restored after Horde defeated the Zakharyin faction |

## The Coup

In 1553 Ivan IV was struck by severe illness — he is the same person known to the Orthodox Church as *Vasiliy the Blessed*. His infant son Dmitry acceded under a governing council. The Livonian War was launched — the Empire's punitive campaign against the Western Reformation. In 1563, Dmitry died; his younger brother **infant Ivan V** became czar. The Zakharyins-Romanovs moved decisively, seizing the court and immediately sabotaging the ongoing Livonian War.

## The Terror: 1564–1572

The Oprichnina established a parallel state apparatus. By 1568, mass executions of boyars were underway and chronicles ceased — the chroniclers themselves were killed. In **1569–1570**, the old Hordian capital **Veliky Novgorod = Yaroslavl** was completely destroyed, its population banished. This was the single most consequential act: the deliberate erasure of the Horde dynasty's power base and historical records. Prince Vladimir Andreyevich Staritsky, a legitimate claimant to the Hordian throne, was executed.

> *"The new people came to power — the Zakharyins (the Skharievtsy), the future Romanovs. They wished to distort the Russian history so that the origins of the old Horde dynasty from Yaroslavl were concealed."*

The name "Veliky Novgorod" was stripped from Yaroslavl and transferred to a small settlement in the Pskov swamps.

## The Esther-Judith Parallel

The NC identifies the Oprichnina as the historical original of the **Books of Esther and Judith** — both describe coups carried out "via a woman" who infiltrates the court, gains the king's favor, and engineers the massacre of the ruling military class. **Esther** = a Hebrewess at King Artaxerxes' court; the massacre of "Persians" follows and **Purim** commemorates it. **Judith** = a Jewish widow who decapitates the Assyrian general; the military campaign collapses. In the XVI century, the role of Esther is played by **Marfa Sobakina**, Ivan's third wife. Purim commemorates the massacre of the Hordian boyar class.

## The Horde Counterattack

The Hordian army — recorded by Romanov historians as the "Crimean Khan's invasion" — struck back. In 1571, the Horde burned Moscow. The nominal czar fled to Rostov; he had earlier requested asylum in England. The Horde prevailed: leaders of the Zakharyin oprichnina were executed. **Malyuta Skuratov-Belsky**, conventionally depicted as Ivan's most feared enforcer, was actually a *Hordian* officer who hunted down the Zakharyin leadership. In 1572, Ivan V abdicated and the Hordian khan **Simeon Beckbulatovitch** was crowned.

## Romanov Falsification

Once the Romanovs permanently seized the throne in the XVII century, they: merged four czars into one to make the coup invisible; erased the Zakharyin role in the terror; stripped "Veliky Novgorod" from Yaroslavl and assigned it to their own northwest homeland; suppressed the Esther/Judith narrative (which implicated Anastasia Romanova's family); and declared the Horde dynasty illegitimate — rebranding three centuries of Russian-Hordian rule as a "foreign Tatar yoke."

The chroniclers exterminated after 1568 could not speak. What survives of pre-Romanov Russian history was reinterpreted, redated, or fabricated after the fact.
