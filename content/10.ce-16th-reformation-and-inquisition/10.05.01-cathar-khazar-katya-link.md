# The Cathar–Khazar–Katya Connection

![The Cathar–Khazar–Katya Connection](/media/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/cathar-khazar-katya.png)

The names **Cathar** and **Khazar** share a common root — **Katya** (Katherine) — and this convergence is not coincidental. Both groups represent the final institutional expressions of the original unified Christianity of the XII–XV centuries, and both were annihilated in the same XVI–XVII century epoch of Reformation and counter-Reformation. Their simultaneous destruction marks the definitive end of the era when "Jews" and "Christians" were **indistinguishable** — members of a single imperial faith that had not yet fractured into the separate denominations familiar today.

## The Katya / Katherine Root

- **Cathar** — from Greek *katharoi* ("the pure ones"), the same root as *catharsis* (purging), *cauterize* (to burn clean), and *Catholic* (*katholikos* = "Holy Katherine"). The Cathars traced their theology to the teachings of **Katya (Katherine)**, the feminine principle of the original XII–XV century Christianity — Christ's mother in the NC reconstruction.

- **Khazar** — Velikovsky, in his unpublished essay *Beyond the Mountains of Darkness*, proposes that "the name 'Khazars,' despite a difference in writing, is to be interpreted as **'Those Who Return'**" — a Hebrew derivation pointing to the Lost Tribes of Israel who settled on the Volga. But the NC framework adds another layer: **Khazar is also a transliteration of the name Katya / Katherine**, the same feminine principle that gave the Cathars their name. The Kazan kingdom — identified by Fomenko as the "ancient" Khazar Khaganate — occupied the Volga region where Velikovsky's Israelite exiles had settled.

- **Katherine / Katya** — the common denominator. The original unified Christianity of the Empire honoured both the masculine and feminine principles — Christ and Katya. After the religious schism of the XV–XVI centuries, the feminine principle was systematically stripped from the doctrine. Those who preserved it — whether in the Gnostic form of the Cathars in France or the Judaic form of the Khazars on the Volga — were declared heretics and destroyed.

## Pre-Schism Unity: Jews and Christians Were Indistinguishable

The modern assumption that Judaism and Christianity are ancient, separate religions is a product of the very schism that destroyed the Cathars and Khazars. In the NC reconstruction:

> *"The Kazan Judaism of the XVI century and contemporary Judaism should not be confused with each other. The present names of the religions originated from positive sounding notions. For instance, Jew meant 'One who praises God'. For a long time these terms were not attached to any of the religious branches."*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 6, §1

Before the schism, there was one imperial faith. "Israel" meant "Fighter for God" — a name for the entire Russia-Horde Empire. "Judaea" meant the Ottoman Empire with its capital at Czar-Grad. "Orthodox" and "Catholic" were synonyms meaning "universal." The distinction between "Jew" and "Christian" did not yet exist in the form we know it.

The Cathars in France — with their Gnostic theology, direct revelation, and Katherine-veneration — and the Khazars on the Volga — with their Hebrew language, Biblical monarch names, and Judaic faith — were **two branches of the same original tree**. Both preserved elements of the pre-schism imperial religion. Both were destroyed when the post-Reformation powers imposed the new denominational system that required sharp boundaries between "Judaism," "Christianity," and "Islam."

## Velikovsky's Complementary Evidence

Immanuel Velikovsky's unpublished essay *Beyond the Mountains of Darkness* (preserved at [SaturnianCosmology.org](http://saturniancosmology.org/files/vel-unpublished/khazars.txt)) independently corroborates the NC framework from a different angle. Velikovsky demonstrates:

- **The Khazar ruling class used Hebrew as its state language** — not as a liturgical import from a later conversion, but as a native tongue: "The ruling class of the Khazars used Hebrew as its language, and the Hebrew faith was the official religion in the realm of the Khazars."

- **The Khazar monarchs bore Biblical names from the era of Samaria's fall** — Hezekiah, Manasseh, Obadiah — names that correspond to the period of the Assyrian exile, not to later rabbinical naming conventions: "It seems not arbitrary to assume that the Khazars absorbed, or even originally were, the remnants of some of the tribes of Israel."

- **Hebrew is the underlying etymological layer of the entire Volga region** — Kazan derives from Gozan (the biblical river of exile), Samara is the biblical Samaria, the Caspian Sea is *caspi* ("of silver" in Hebrew), Rostov means "The Good Harbor" in Hebrew.

- **The "conversion" to Judaism was actually a purification** — not an external adoption of a foreign faith, but "an act of return to the old Hebrew religion of Yahweh" after centuries of semi-literate drift from the original tradition.

Velikovsky was not aware of the NC framework, but his conclusions converge: the Khazars were not converts — they were *originals*. Their Hebrew-language, Yahweh-worshipping, Biblically-named kingdom on the Volga was not a medieval curiosity but a direct survival of the pre-schism imperial faith, continuous from the Israelite exile to the XVI century destruction by Ivan the Terrible.

## Simultaneous Annihilation

The critical observation is the **simultaneity** of destruction:

| Group | Region | Destroyed by | Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cathars** | Southern France (Languedoc) | Albigensian Crusade → Inquisition → Reformation | XIII–XVII cc. (NC: XV–XVII cc.) |
| **Khazars** | Volga (Kazan) | Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan | 1552 CE |

Both were eliminated within the same century-long epoch. Both were charged with religious deviance from the emerging post-schism orthodoxies. Both had preserved elements — feminine theology, direct revelation, pre-denominational unity — that were incompatible with the new order. The Cathars were [suppressed by the Inquisition](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md) and then [annihilated in the reversed Holy Crusade](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.03-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md). The Khazars were [crushed at Kazan](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.05.00-1552-ce-khazar-rebellion-in-the-russia-horde-empire.md) and absorbed into the post-conquest Russian state.

Together, their destruction closed the door on the original Christian revolution started by Christ and Katya. Both cultures went underground, their memory surviving only in:
- **Eastern religions** where Katya is still venerated above all else — under the name **Mary Magdalene**
- **Gnostic and troubadour traditions** encoding dual-principle cosmology in symbolic form
- **The words themselves** — Cathar, Catholic, cauterize, catharsis — all echoing the Katherine root that was burned from history
