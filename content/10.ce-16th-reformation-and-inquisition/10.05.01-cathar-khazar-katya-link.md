# The Cathar–Khazar–Katya Connection

![The Cathar–Khazar–Katya Connection](/media/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/cathar-khazar-katya.png)

The names **Cathar** and **Khazar** share a common root — **Katya** (Katherine). Both groups represent the final institutional expressions of the original unified Christianity of the XII–XV centuries, both annihilated in the XVI–XVII century Reformation. Their simultaneous destruction marks the end of the era when "Jews" and "Christians" were **indistinguishable**.

## The Katya / Katherine Root

- **Cathar** — from Greek *katharoi* ("the pure ones"), same root as *catharsis*, *cauterize*, *Catholic* (*katholikos* = "Holy Katherine"). The Cathars traced theology to **Katya (Katherine)** — the feminine principle of original Christianity, Christ's mother in the NC reconstruction.

- **Khazar** — Velikovsky proposes "Those Who Return" (Hebrew derivation). The NC adds: Khazar is also a transliteration of **Katya / Katherine**. The Kazan kingdom — Fomenko's "ancient" Khazar Khaganate — occupied the Volga region.

- **Katherine / Katya** — the common denominator. Original unified Christianity honoured both masculine and feminine principles — Christ and Katya. After the XV–XVI century schism, the feminine was stripped from doctrine. Those who preserved it — Gnostic Cathars in France or Judaic Khazars on the Volga — were declared heretics and destroyed.

## Pre-Schism Unity

> *"Kazan Judaism of the XVI century and contemporary Judaism should not be confused. 'Jew' meant 'One who praises God'. For a long time these terms were not attached to any religious branches."*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*

Before the schism: one imperial faith. "Israel" = "Fighter for God" (the entire Russia-Horde). "Judaea" = the Ottoman Empire. "Orthodox" and "Catholic" were synonyms meaning "universal." The Cathars (Gnostic theology, Katherine-veneration) and Khazars (Hebrew language, Judaic faith) were **two branches of the same tree**, both preserving pre-schism elements.

## Velikovsky's Complementary Evidence

Velikovsky's unpublished *Beyond the Mountains of Darkness* ([SaturnianCosmology.org](http://saturniancosmology.org/files/vel-unpublished/khazars.txt)) independently corroborates:

- The Khazar ruling class used **Hebrew as its state language** — not a liturgical import but a native tongue
- Khazar monarchs bore **Biblical names from Samaria's fall** (Hezekiah, Manasseh, Obadiah)
- Hebrew underlies the entire Volga region etymologically — Kazan = Gozan, Samara = Samaria, Caspian = *caspi* ("silver" in Hebrew)
- The "conversion" to Judaism was **a return** to original Yahweh-worship, not foreign adoption

The Khazars were not converts — they were *originals*.

## Simultaneous Annihilation

| Group | Region | Destroyed by | Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cathars** | Southern France | Albigensian Crusade → Inquisition | XIII–XVII cc. |
| **Khazars** | Volga (Kazan) | Ivan the Terrible's siege | 1552 CE |

Both eliminated in the same century, both charged with religious deviance, both preserving elements incompatible with the new denominational order. The Cathars were [suppressed by the Inquisition](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md) and [annihilated](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.01-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md). The Khazars were [crushed at Kazan](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.05.00-1552-ce-khazar-rebellion-in-the-russia-horde-empire.md).

Their memory survives in Eastern religions venerating Katya as **Mary Magdalene**, in Gnostic traditions encoding dual-principle cosmology, and in the words themselves — Cathar, Catholic, cauterize, catharsis — echoing the Katherine root burned from history.
