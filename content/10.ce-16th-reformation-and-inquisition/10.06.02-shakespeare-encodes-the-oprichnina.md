# Shakespeare Encodes the Oprichnina

Shakespeare's plays **King Lear** and **Henry VIII** encode the XVI century events of the [Oprichnina](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.00-1565-ce-romanov-dynasty-stages-the-oprichnina-coup.md) — the Zakharyin-Romanov coup that destroyed the Horde dynasty from within. For the full analysis — including identifications for Hamlet, Macbeth, Timon of Athens, and Titus Andronicus — see the primary article: [Shakespeare Encodes the Great Empire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.05-shakespeare-encodes-the-horde.md).

## XVI Century Plays and the Oprichnina

Two of Shakespeare's plays encode the specific events of the [Oprichnina](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.00-1565-ce-romanov-dynasty-stages-the-oprichnina-coup.md):

- **King Lear** = Khan Ivan the Terrible — the aging king who divides his realm and is destroyed by the ungrateful factions. Lear's madness = Ivan's manipulation by the Oprichniki; Cordelia = the Horde-loyalist faction.
- **Henry VIII** = Ivan the Terrible (second reflection) — Catherine of Aragon = Sophia Palaiologina; Anne Boleyn = Elena Voloshanka = Biblical [Esther](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.01-redacted-into-the-books-of-esther-judith.md). The king's rejection of his legitimate wife for a dangerous newcomer encodes the same court infiltration described in the [Books of Esther and Judith](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.01-redacted-into-the-books-of-esther-judith.md).

Shakespeare was writing no more than 50 years after the events he encoded. The displacement into "English history" is the same geographical obfuscation applied to all Hordian chronicles — Russian events were relocated to England, France, Scotland, Denmark, and Rome by the XVII–XVIII century chronological project.
