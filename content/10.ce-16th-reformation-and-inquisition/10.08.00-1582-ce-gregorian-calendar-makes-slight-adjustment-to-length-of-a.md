# Gregorian Calendar makes slight adjustment to length of a year

In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar, ostensibly to correct a 10-day drift in the Julian calendar that had accumulated since the Council of Nicaea (325 CE). The reform deleted 10 days from October 1582 and adjusted the leap year rule so that century years not divisible by 400 would no longer be leap years — changing the average year length from 365.25 to 365.2425 days. This created the split between "Old Style" (Julian) and "New Style" (Gregorian) calendars that persists to this day — Russia did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1918.

## The Stated Reason vs. the True Reason

The official justification for the reform was that the vernal equinox had drifted from March 21 (where the Council of Nicaea supposedly fixed it in 325 CE) to March 11 by 1582. The Paschal calendar — the system for computing Easter — depended on the equinox falling on March 21, and the 10-day error was causing Easter to drift away from its astronomically correct date.

Fomenko and Nosovskiy demonstrate in [Chapter 7, §34](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_34.html) that this stated reason conceals a deeper problem. The Paschal calendar (Computus) — the system that determines when Easter falls — **could not have been established at the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE**. Their astronomical analysis shows:

> The Council which established Paschal could not have taken place earlier than 784, as only beginning with this year, due to the slow astronomical shift of the moon phases, the concurrencies of the calendar Christian Easter and the Jewish Passover had ceased.

In other words, the fundamental rule of Easter — that it must **not** coincide with Jewish Passover — would have been violated repeatedly in the IV century if the Paschal calendar had been in use then. The Computus was actually compiled no earlier than the VIII–XI centuries, and canonized at a council in the XI–XIV centuries — not in 325 CE.

The Gregorian reform of 1582 was therefore not correcting 1,257 years of drift from the Council of Nicaea. It was correcting a much shorter period of drift from the actual establishment of the Computus — and simultaneously **creating the false impression** that the Church calendar had been in continuous use since the IV century.

## The Scaligerian Year Zero

The reform was intimately connected to the construction of the Scaligerian chronological system. The Anno Domini ("Current Era") — the system that numbers years from the birth of Christ — was supposedly calculated by the Roman monk Dionysius Exiguus in the VI century. Fomenko notes:

> *"It is well known that since the beginning of A.D. (Anno Domini, 'Current Era') there was no continuous yearly calculation until the current year. The first year 'A.D.' was calculated much later as the year of the Nativity of Christ."*

Dionysius' calculations were "controversial in the West up until the XV century, and in Byzantium were never canonized." The systematic use of the Anno Domini era began only from 1431 in the West — over 900 years after it was supposedly devised. Fomenko proposes that "Dionysius the Small" (*Exiguus* in Latin) is a phantom of the XVII century chronologist **Dionysius Petavius**, who completed the construction of the Scaligerian chronology. In French, "Small" = *petit*, which became *Petavius*.

The Gregorian calendar reform of 1582, the construction of the Anno Domini era, and the publication of Scaliger's *De emendatione temporum* (1583 — one year after the Gregorian reform) were **simultaneous, coordinated operations**. They replaced the Empire's existing calendar systems — including the Byzantine era ("from Adam," which placed creation at 5508 BC) — with a new chronological framework that pushed the birth of Christ approximately 1,053 years into the past and created the illusion of an unbroken chain of Church history stretching back to antiquity.

## What Was Replaced

The lunisolar calendar of the Rus-Horde Empire operated on different principles:
- **13 months of 28 days** (with leap months to synchronize with solar years), versus the Gregorian system of 12 months of uneven lengths
- **Month names derived from natural phenomena** — e.g. Feb 5th: "Beginning of Spring"; Feb 19th: "Rain Water"; Apr 5th: "[Pure Brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival)" — versus months renamed after figures from the fabricated Roman history: January after Janus (a war god absent from the Greek pantheon), March after Mars (god of war), July after Julius Caesar (a [redaction](https://catholicfundamentalism.com/similarities-between-julius-caesar-and-jesus-christ/22546) of Christ), August after Augustus Caesar (also a reflection of Christ)

The Gregorian reform was not merely a technical adjustment to the length of a year. It was part of the broader chronological project that erected the Scaligerian timeline, backdated the Church to the IV century, and erased the memory of the Empire's own calendrical systems.
