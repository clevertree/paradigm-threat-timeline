# Khazar Rebellion in the Russia-Horde Empire

In the middle of the XVI century the **Kazan kingdom** — identified by Fomenko and Nosovskiy as none other than the
legendary "ancient" [Khazar Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Khaganate) — becomes the centre of a new
Judaic religious movement. The Kazan czar (i.e. the Khazar Kagan) and his court convert to Judaism and attempt to
break away from the [Russia-Horde Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire) and form an independent kingdom.
In 1552, the czar-khan of Veliky Novgorod — Ivan the "Terrible" — severely crushed the revolt.

The name Khazar is also a transliteration of the name Katya / Katherine. The *annihilation* of the Khazars along with the
Cathars effectively ended the original Christian revolution started by Christ and Katya (who were long dead and buried).
Both cultures went [underground](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/virg/hd_virg.htm) and became heavily redacted in
History to the point of being denied by modern scholars, and yet in the Eastern religions today Katya is still worshiped
above all else (including Christ) — just under a different name — Mary Magdalene. Khazarian Judaism differed from modern
Messianic Judaism in many ways, most importantly that the Messiah, Christ i.e. King
Solomon the [Sun King](https://www.solarancestor.com/regular-blog-posts/-sol-om-on-a-sun-king), had *already* arrived.

## Kazan = The Khazar Khaganate

The mainstream historical consensus places the Khazar Khaganate in the VII–X centuries and treats it as a distinct
civilization that collapsed long before the XVI century. The [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_01.html)
of Fomenko and Nosovskiy rejects this dating entirely. Kazan and the "Khazar Khaganate" are the same polity, in the same
region, in the same century — the apparent separation into two distinct historical entities is a product of the
chronological displacement that stretches the XVI century backwards by several hundred years.

This identification is not arbitrary. Both the Kazan kingdom and the canonical Khaganate:
- Were centered on the middle Volga
- Were ruled by a Kagan/Khan
- Were known for a court conversion to Judaism
- Attempted religious and political independence from the dominant northern power
- Were violently suppressed by Rus

The "ancient" Khazar Khaganate of the history books is a phantom duplicate of XVI century Kazan, shifted ~600 years
earlier by Scaligerian chronologists.

## What "Judaism," "Israel," and "Judaea" Actually Meant

Before accepting that "Kazan converted to Judaism," the terms must be understood in their XVI century context — not
their modern one. Fomenko and Nosovskiy are explicit:

> *"The Kazan Judaism of the XVI century and contemporary Judaism should not be confused with each other. The present names of the religions originated from positive sounding notions. For instance, Jew meant 'One who praises God'. For a long time these terms were not attached to any of the religious branches."*
> — *How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 6, §1

The political-religious geography of the Empire in the XIV–XVI centuries:

| Term | XVI century meaning |
|---|---|
| **Israel** | "Fighter for God" — a religiously tinged name for the entire Russia-Horde Empire |
| **Judaea** | The Ottoman Empire (Atamania), with its capital at the Biblical Jerusalem = Czar-Grad |
| **Jew** | "One who praises God" — a positive religious epithet, not an ethnic label |
| **Orthodox** | Universal Christianity as practiced in Russia-Horde |
| **Catholic** | Originally synonymous with "Orthodox" (universal); only later narrowed to the Western church |

Judaism itself, in the New Chronology's reading, is not an ancient religion predating Christianity. It is one of several
branches that *split off* from the unified Royal Christianity of the XII–XV centuries. All major religions known today —
Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Judaism — emerged from this single root and differentiated only
in the XV–XVII centuries. That is why medieval scholarship in the XIX century kept finding deep commonalities between
them: they were not "influences" flowing into Christianity from earlier cults, but fragments of the same original faith
diverging outward. The Khazar/Kazan conversion was therefore a religious *secession within the Empire's own
theological tradition* — not the imposition of a foreign ancient faith.

## The Conquest of Kazan (1552) and its Encoded Doubles

The military campaign against Kazan was a major imperial operation. Before crossing the Volga to besiege Kazan, Ivan the
Terrible's army first built the fortress city of **Sviyazhsk** as a forward supply base and crossing point on the river.
This logistical masterstroke — building a fortified city to stage a river crossing before a major punitive campaign — was
significant enough to be recorded independently by classical sources, where it appears in two separate disguised forms:

### Herodotus: Cambyses Conquers Memphis
In *The Histories*, King Cambyses II conquers "Egyptian Memphis." In the New Chronology, Cambyses II = Ivan the Terrible,
and "Egypt" is a cipher name for Russia-Horde. The conquest of Egypt's capital Memphis = the conquest of Kazan. The
Egyptian "Memphis" and the Volga "Kazan" are the same event encoded for a different audience.

### Herodotus: Xerxes Builds a Bridge Across Hellespont
Also in *The Histories*, King Xerxes (again, = Ivan the Terrible) builds a massive bridge across the Hellespont to
transport a Persian army from Asia into Europe — a punitive campaign against the Greeks "for disobedience." In the New
Chronology, Xerxes' "Hellespont bridge" is the city of Sviyazhsk, built to move Ivan's army across the Volga before
the siege of Kazan. The "punitive campaign against disobedient Greeks" is the campaign against the rebellious Kazan
Khanate. The name Hellespont — a narrow strait — maps onto the Volga crossing.

The same event is also intertwined in the chronicles with the **Ottoman seizure of Czar-Grad in 1453**. The capture of
Kazan (1552) and the capture of Constantinople (1453) were so structurally similar — a czar-khan besieging and taking a
rebellious city from which a religious rival operated — that the chronicles of the two events were merged and confused
by later historians.

## Connection to the Western Reformation

The Kazan rebellion did not occur in isolation. At the same moment in the mid-XVI century, Western European governors
were forming their own rebellion against the distant czar-khan of Veliky Novgorod, using Lutheranism as their ideological
banner. In Russia, this Protestant movement was called the *heresy of the Judaizers* — the same religious label applied
to the Kazan court. The two rebellions share:

- A banner of religious separation from the Empire's Orthodox Christian metropoly
- A link to the "Judaizer" movement, which operated as a secret network inside the imperial court
- Simultaneous timing in the mid-XVI century

Fomenko and Nosovskiy note the possibility of a direct connection:

> *"It is possible, that there was some kind of connection between Kazan = Khazar Judaism and the Western Reformation, Protestantism."*
> — *How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 6, §1

Martin Luther himself was likely a sincere religious reformer and a loyal subject of the Empire. The political class
that weaponized Lutheranism for secession was a different constituency — the same network of Western governors who would
later appear as the pro-Western faction inside the Russian court, the **Zakharyins-Romanovs**.

## After Kazan: The Livonian War

Having crushed the Kazan rebellion, Russia-Horde turned its attention westward. The decision was made to send a
punitive campaign to suppress the Western Reformation — the same religious revolt that had been connected to the
Kazan secession. In Russian sources this became the **Livonian War**.

The name "Livonia" was later deliberately shrunk by Romanov historians to refer only to a small Baltic region. In
reality, the target was the *entire* rebelling Western Europe. The Livonian War was the Empire's planned third
conquest of Europe — intended to bring the Protestant princes back into submission. The campaign was fully prepared
and launched. It was only the **Zakharyin-Romanov coup from within** — the Oprichnina — that permanently aborted it.
