# Khazar Rebellion in the Russia-Horde Empire

In the mid-XVI century, the **Kazan kingdom** — identified by Fomenko and Nosovskiy as the legendary "ancient" [Khazar Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Khaganate) — became the centre of a Judaic religious movement. The Kazan czar (Khazar Kagan) converted to Judaism and attempted to break away from the [Russia-Horde Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire). In 1552, the czar-khan of Veliky Novgorod — Ivan the "Terrible" — crushed the revolt.

The name Khazar is also a transliteration of Katya/Katherine. The annihilation of the Khazars and the [Cathars](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md) effectively ended the original Christian revolution. Both cultures went underground, heavily redacted to the point of being denied by modern scholars — yet in the Eastern traditions, Katya is still worshipped above all else as Mary Magdalene. Khazarian Judaism differed from modern Messianic Judaism: the Messiah, Christ i.e. King Solomon the [Sun King](https://www.solarancestor.com/regular-blog-posts/-sol-om-on-a-sun-king), had *already* arrived.

## Kazan = The Khazar Khaganate

The mainstream consensus places the Khaganate in the VII–X centuries. The [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_01.html) rejects this dating: Kazan and the Khaganate are the same polity, same region, same century. Both were centred on the middle Volga, ruled by a Kagan/Khan, known for a court conversion to Judaism, attempted political independence from the northern power, and were violently suppressed by Rus. The "ancient" Khaganate is a phantom shifted ~600 years earlier by Scaligerian chronologists.

## What "Judaism" and "Israel" Actually Meant

> *"The Kazan Judaism of the XVI century and contemporary Judaism should not be confused with each other. The present names of the religions originated from positive sounding notions. For instance, Jew meant 'One who praises God'."*
> — *How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 6, §1

In the XIV–XVI centuries: **Israel** = "Fighter for God," a name for the entire Russia-Horde Empire. **Judaea** = the Ottoman Empire (Atamania). **Jew** = "One who praises God," a positive epithet, not an ethnic label. Judaism is not an ancient religion predating Christianity — it is one of several branches that split from the unified Royal Christianity of the XII–XV centuries. The Khazar/Kazan conversion was a *religious secession within the Empire's own tradition*.

## The Conquest of Kazan (1552) and Its Encoded Doubles

Ivan the Terrible's army built the fortress city of **Sviyazhsk** as a forward base before crossing the Volga to besiege Kazan. In classical sources this operation appears in two disguises: Herodotus records King **Cambyses** conquering "Egyptian Memphis" (= Kazan), and King **Xerxes** building a bridge across the Hellespont (= Sviyazhsk, crossing the Volga) for a punitive campaign against "disobedient Greeks" (= the rebellious Khanate).

## Connection to the Western Reformation

The Kazan rebellion coincided with Western European governors forming their own rebellion using Lutheranism as their ideological banner. In Russia, this Protestant movement was called the *heresy of the Judaizers*. Both rebellions shared religious separation from the Empire's Orthodox metropoly, links to the Judaizer network inside the imperial court, and simultaneous mid-XVI century timing. Martin Luther was likely a sincere reformer — the political class that weaponized Lutheranism for secession was a different constituency: the **Zakharyins-Romanovs**.

## After Kazan: The Livonian War

Having crushed Kazan, Russia-Horde turned westward. The **Livonian War** — the Empire's planned third European conquest to suppress the Reformation — was launched. "Livonia" was later shrunk by Romanov historians to a small Baltic region; in reality, the entire rebelling Western Europe was the target. The campaign was permanently aborted by the **[Zakharyin-Romanov coup](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.00-1565-ce-romanov-dynasty-stages-the-oprichnina-coup.md)** from within.

## Velikovsky: The Khazars as Lost Tribes of Israel

Independent corroboration comes from Immanuel Velikovsky's unpublished essay *Beyond the Mountains of Darkness* ([SaturnianCosmology.org](http://saturniancosmology.org/files/vel-unpublished/khazars.txt)). Without knowledge of the NC, Velikovsky concluded the Khazars were direct descendants of the **Ten Lost Tribes of Israel**, exiled to the Volga by Assyrian kings. Hebrew was the state language. Khazar kings bore biblical monarch names from the era of Samaria's fall (Hezekiah, Manasseh, Obadiah) — suggesting continuity, not conversion. The name "Khazars" derives from Hebrew as "Those Who Return." Geographic names confirm the link: Kazan from Gozan (the biblical river of exile), Samara from Samaria, the Caspian from *caspi* ("of silver" in Hebrew).

Where Fomenko identifies the chronological displacement, Velikovsky independently identifies the ethnic continuity. Together they explain a Hebrew-speaking, biblically-named kingdom on the Volga.
