# The Holy Inquisition

The empire established the *Inquisition Court* in 1542 to quell ethnic tension and investigate the Reformation. [Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html):

> The institution of the inquisition was founded in 1542, and it eventually swept over the entire Western Europe. There has never been any such institution founded inside the Orthodox Church—it wasn't required.

The court's mission included eradicating sodomy, witchcraft, and "perversions" allegedly causing the 1492 Apocalypse, plus belief systems antithetical to Church teachings. French poet [Celestin Douais](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html) argued the courts *"were created in the interests of the heretics, saving them from pogroms and uncontrollable persecution... helping to maintain order and curb propagation of major evils."*

## Why No Inquisition in the Orthodox East

In the NC framework, Western Catholicism incorporated the **bacchanalian-orgiastic** form of old Christian liturgy — a degenerated cult preserving ceremonial sexuality (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §3). As consequence, diseases spread across Western Europe, called "venereal" after Venus, goddess of love. Eastern Orthodox and Ottoman branches remained ascetic and never developed these practices — so they never required a corrective institution. The Inquisition's absence in the Orthodox Church is evidence that **the problem it solved never arose there**.

## The Inquisition as Imperial Medical Operation

The NC framework is explicit: the Inquisition was a **military-medical quarantine** apparatus of the Russia-Horde Empire (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §38):

> *The Khans found themselves confronting a serious state problem. The medics could not offer effective mass treatment. Then the Khans made the only correct decision — to wipe out the diseased population using military force. To burn down houses of the sick. Soldiers were given orders not to contact infected people, avoid local food and water, disinfect weapons.*

The division into "righteous" and "sinners" — the Apocalypse's Last Judgement — was **segregation of infected from clean**. The fires were quarantine fires. The crimes prosecuted — sexual immorality, ritual orgies, "sodomy" — were the exact behaviors spreading disease.

## Two Views: NC Positive vs. Scaligerian Negative

| Axis | Scaligerian View | NC View |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Religious persecution; torture for doctrinal conformity | Imperial public health; response to epidemic-generating cult |
| **Methods** | Arbitrary torture, mass execution | Better organized than regular courts |
| **Victims** | Innocent dissenters | Practitioners of bacchanalian cult and epidemics |
| **Biblical encoding** | No connection | Book of Judges = Epoch of Inquisition; treats it *sympathetically* |

## The "Hatred of the Doctor" Problem

Western Europe experienced the "surgery" as traumatic. Survivors remembered the pain but forgot the epidemic it cured. Reformists exploited this *hatred of the doctor* to justify breaking from the Empire (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §38): *"The grievance for sufferings inflicted during compulsory treatment took precedence. The memory of 'pain' was used by reformists to ferment conditions justifying their ambitions to split the Empire."*

The "crimes of the Inquisition" narrative was **manufactured retroactively** by Reformation powers — then encoded into Scaligerian historiography by XVII–XVIII century scholars. Philip II of Spain, framed as tyrant for "supporting the Inquisition," was actually a loyal imperial governor fighting the Reformation.

## The Reversed Inquisition

The critical distinction: **original** vs. **reversed** phases.

- **Original Inquisition (XV–XVI c.):** Imperial public health; targeted orgiastic cult and epidemics; operated under Horde and Ottoman authority; *sympathetically* encoded in Book of Judges
- **Reversed Inquisition (XVI–XVII c.):** Same machinery turned by Reformation powers against **Cathars**, old-Empire loyalists, and Gnostic remnants — populations the original Inquisition had *protected*

The **Reversed Inquisition** accounts for genuine atrocities: burning of Cathars, Joan of Arc, Gilles de Rais, and thousands whose crime was loyalty to the old faith and Empire.
