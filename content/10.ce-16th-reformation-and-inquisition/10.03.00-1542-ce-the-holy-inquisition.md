# The Holy Inquisition

The empire reacted to reports of ethnic tension and established the *Inquisition Court* to quell the unrest and
investigate the Reformation that was causing it. [Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html):

> The institution of the inquisition was founded in 1542, and it eventually swept over the entire Western Europe. There
> has never been any such institution founded inside the Orthodox Church-it wasn't required.
> We must linger on the frequently disputed “crimes of the inquisition” for a while. We have been fed the version that
> the institution of the inquisition in the Western Europe was characterised by horrendous and strangely senseless
> cruelty – fires whereupon innocent people would be burnt alive are supposed to have blaze all across Europe.
> Simultaneously, there is another point of view on the matter, voiced by a number of West Europeans, according to
> which the inquisition trials weren’t any crueller than the regular courts of that epoch. Moreover – these courts
> were better organised, and less prone to arbitrary action.

The court's mission was also the eradication of sodomy, witchcraft, and other "perversions" that allegedly resulted in
the recent 1492 Apocalypse. It also went after belief systems antithetical to the Churches teachings such as Sun worship
or [Copernicanism](https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system). French
poet [Celestin Douais](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html) claimed:

> [the inquisition courts] were created in the interests of the heretics, saving them from pogroms, indiscriminate
> massacres and uncontrollable persecution. The inquisition courts also contributed to the preservation of the epoch’s
> civilisation, helping to maintain order and to curb the propagation of major evils, protecting the century’s interests
> and truly standing guard of social justice and the Christian ideology

When the populace searched for answers, the ecclesiastical hierarchy lectured them on how the Black Death was God's retribution for their wicked ways. In Spain, tolerance of the "killers of Christ" was among them. Soon tales of Jews pouring poisonous powder into wells circulated throughout what is now Germany and France.*

## Why There Was No Inquisition in the Orthodox East

To understand the Inquisition it is essential to first ask why it existed *only* in the West.

In the NC framework, the unified Christianity of the XII–XV century had three regional expressions by
the XV century. The Eastern Orthodox tradition — centered in Russia-Horde — remained **ascetic**
throughout. The Ottoman/Islamic branch was equally austere. But Western Catholicism had
incorporated what Fomenko & Nosovskiy call the **bacchanalian-orgiastic** form of the
old Christian liturgy — a degenerated cult that preserved ceremonial sexuality alongside its
Christian doctrine (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §3):

> *In the XV-XVI cc. Catholicism existed in the form of the 'ancient' Greek and Roman pantheon of
> the gods with bacchanalian and orgiastic elements. As a consequence of such practices spreading,
> diseases occurred in some of the countries of Western Europe, which were called venereal diseases
> after Venus — the goddess of love.*

The Eastern and Ottoman branches never developed these practices, so they never required a corrective
institution. The Inquisition's absence in the Orthodox Church is therefore not evidence of
superior tolerance — it is evidence that the **problem the Inquisition was designed to solve never
arose there**.

## The Bacchanalian Cult: What the Inquisition Was Actually Fighting

The Western "diabolical Sabbath" described in medieval witch-trial records was not, in the NC reading,
an invention of superstitious peasants. It was a **renamed and condemned memory** of quite recent
Christian liturgical practice. Fomenko & Nosovskiy describe it (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §9):

> *The famous descriptions of the 'diabolical Sabbaths' in Western Europe tell us about the same
> Christian 'agape'-Bacchanalias, but already declared by the reformers of the Western Church to be
> the 'work of the devil'. One of the main characteristics of the agape-Sabbaths, as the Scaligerian
> history tells us, were the orgiastic Bacchanalia. Naturally, the new Western 'Renovated Church' put
> the onus for the agape-Bacchanalia on the 'devil' in order to smother any recollections among the
> congregation of their quite recent bacchic-Christian past.*

Medieval European cathedrals preserve the archaeological evidence. Pornographic carvings were found in
the churches of Bourges. Pompeii — which NC dates to the XVI–XVII century, not antiquity — was a site
of mass orgiastic practice, its streets lined with brothels and explicit frescoes. The "pagan temples"
over which Christian churches were "built" were simply the same buildings, renamed after the reform
condemned what had happened inside them.

The Inquisition's mandate to eradicate witchcraft, sodomy, and sexual ritual was therefore
**public health policy** dressed in theological language — a response to the epidemics of venereal
disease that had spread across Western Europe from exactly these practices.

## The Inquisition as Imperial Medical Operation

The NC framework is explicit that the Inquisition was not foremost a theological institution. It was a
**military-medical quarantine** apparatus of the Russia-Horde Empire, deployed against a population
whose religious practices had generated epidemic disease (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §38):

> *The Khans of the Empire found themselves confronting a serious state problem. But at that primitive
> level of the development of medicine the causes of the disease and its proliferation were not clear.
> The medics could not offer any effective methods of mass treatment. And then the Khans of the Empire
> made the only, as they thought, correct decision — to wipe out the diseased population of the
> infected regions using military force. To burn down the houses of the sick. The soldiers were given
> orders not to come into contact with the infected people. To avoid the local food and water. Swords
> and all weapons in general had to be disinfected, cleansed with fire and boiled in water. Clothes to
> be periodically incinerated…*

The division of the population into "righteous" and "sinners" — encoded in the Apocalypse as the
**Last Judgement** — was in reality the **segregation of the infected from the clean**. The fires of
the Inquisition were quarantine fires. The specific crimes prosecuted — sexual immorality, communal
ritual orgies, "sodomy" — were the exact behaviors spreading the diseases in question.

The Book of Judges in the Old Testament, which NC identifies as the encoded record of the XVI-century
Inquisition epoch, **presents the Inquisition sympathetically or neutrally** — consistent with a record
written by those who believed the campaign was justified (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.6 §31):

> *The Old Testament Book of Judges perceives the Inquisition either sympathetically or neutrally,
> which corresponds very well with the point we are making.*

## Two Views: The NC Positive vs. The Scaligerian Negative

| Axis | Scaligerian (Mainstream) View | NC (Fomenko/Nosovskiy) View |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Religious persecution; enforcing doctrinal conformity by torture | Imperial public health + social order; response to epidemic-generating orgiastic cult |
| **Founding** | Medieval Catholic Church initiative, XIII century | Russia-Horde Empire mandate; formally 1542; XIII c. wave is a phantom reflection |
| **Methods** | Arbitrary torture, show trials, mass execution of innocents | Better organized than regular courts; "less prone to arbitrary action" |
| **Victims** | Innocent dissenters, scientists, heretics | Practitioners of the bacchanalian cult and its associated epidemics |
| **Geographic scope** | Western Europe, incidentally | Western Europe *only* — because only Western Christianity developed the bacchanalian cult |
| **Biblical encoding** | No connection | Book of Judges = Epoch of Inquisition; Judges treats it **sympathetically** |
| **Why no Orthodox Inquisition** | Orthodox Church was more tolerant | Eastern Christianity remained ascetic; the *problem* never developed there |

Fomenko & Nosovskiy directly address the source of the negative view (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.6 §31):

> *Today the role of the Inquisition was distorted and the pervasively negative attitude towards it
> is a result of Scaligerian brain-washing.*

## The "Hatred of the Doctor" Problem

The NC model offers a political explanation for why the negative view won. Western Europe experienced
the "surgical treatment" as traumatic even where it was medically necessary. Survivors remembered
the pain of the "surgery" but forgot the epidemic it cured. Reformist actors exploited this
*hatred of the doctor* to justify breaking from the Empire (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.5 §38):

> *The shock experienced by Western Europe in the XV-XVI cc. bred within some social groups a
> deeply entrenched enmity towards the 'surgeons', i.e. towards the Atamania (Ottoman Empire) and
> Russia-Horde, a hatred which had not been felt before. That the 'surgeon' had cured the
> 'bacchanalian drug addiction' was a fact condemned to oblivion. It was the grievance for the
> sufferings inflicted during the compulsory treatment that took precedence. The memory of the 'pain'
> experienced before was used by the Western reformists determined to exert their control. It acted
> like an enzyme which fermented and created the conditions to justify their ambitions and aspirations
> to split the Empire.*

The "crimes of the Inquisition" narrative was therefore **manufactured retroactively** by the
Reformation powers who broke from the Empire — then encoded into Scaligerian historiography by the
scholars they patronized in the XVII–XVIII centuries.

This is demonstrated concretely in the treatment of **Philip II of Spain** (1527–1598). The
post-Reformation Encyclopaedia calls him a bad ruler and oppressor for "supporting the Inquisition."
NC reads him as a *loyal imperial governor* fighting the Reformation — repackaged as a tyrant by the
winning side. The propaganda book *The Mirror of Spanish Tyranny*, published 1596 and reprinted 1620
and 1638, depicted Philip II and the Duke of Alba as monsters torturing "good people" — produced
precisely to educate Europeans "in the required spirit" (*How It Was In Reality*, Ch.9 §5).

## The Reversed Inquisition

The most important distinction in evaluating the Inquisition is between its **original** phase and
its **reversed** phase after the Reformation captured the machinery.

- **Original Inquisition (XV–XVI c.):** Imperial public health and social order mechanism; targeted
  the orgiastic cult and its epidemic consequences; operated under Horde and Ottoman authority;
  *sympathetically* encoded in the Old Testament Book of Judges

- **Reversed Inquisition (XVI–XVII c.):** The same institutional machinery, turned by Reformation
  powers against **Cathars**, old-Empire loyalists, and Gnostic Christian remnants — the very
  populations the original Inquisition had *protected*

It is the **Reversed Inquisition** that accounts for the genuine atrocities attached to the
institution's name: the burning of Cathars, Joan of Arc, Gilles de Rais, and thousands whose crime
was not orgiastic immorality but **loyalty to the old faith and the old Empire**.

By blaming the Inquisition-as-institution for crimes committed under its post-Reformation version,
Scaligerian historiography successfully condemned the original imperial public health campaign for
the atrocities of the very rebellion that overthrew it. See
[Cathar Suppression](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md) and
[Cathars are annihilated in a reversed "Holy" Crusade & Inquisition](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.01-cathars-are-annihilated-in-a-reversed-holy-crusade-inquisition.md).
