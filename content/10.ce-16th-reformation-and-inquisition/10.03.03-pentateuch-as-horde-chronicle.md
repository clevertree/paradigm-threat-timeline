# The Pentateuch as a Horde Chronicle

Fomenko and Nosovskiy make one of their most striking claims in [Chapter 8, §7](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08_07.html) of *How It Was In Reality*:

> *"Today we are being told about Kremlin of the XVI–XVII cc., mainly using the words of foreign travellers, diplomats, writers and merchants who visited Moscow and left some kind of notes. But where are the Hordian authors and documents? Much fewer of those survived. It was driven into our minds that in poor Russia they were allegedly bad at writing history down. May we question it. The Hordians wrote well and a lot. For example, they created the significant part of the Old Testament including the Pentateuch. But in the epoch of the Time of Troubles and the Romanovs pogrom-occupation they could not hold on to the major segments of their history. They took it away from us and attributed it to others. Instead they invented for us and bequeathed to us the 'gloomy Tatar yoke'. Which is still taught at school."*

This claim is not peripheral — it strikes at the heart of the identity question surrounding the Old Testament. If the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) was composed by Hordian authors in the XV–XVI centuries, then the "ancient Israelites" of the Pentateuch are the Russia-Horde Empire itself, and the "ancient history" recorded in these books is the medieval history of the Empire, displaced thousands of years into the past by Scaligerian chronologists.

## What the Claim Means

In the New Chronology framework, the Old Testament is not an ancient text. Its books were composed in the XV–XVII centuries, drawing on real events and real geography, then deliberately pushed backwards in time:

- **Genesis** — creation narrative and patriarchal genealogies reflecting the founding mythology of the Empire
- **Exodus** — the great migration narrative, identified by Fomenko as a reflection of the Ottoman/Horde conquests of the XV century (see [The Reverse Exodus Theory](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.07.00-the-reverse-exodus-theory.md))
- **Leviticus / Numbers** — priestly law and census records of the Empire's administrative structure
- **Deuteronomy** — the second law-giving, reflecting the post-schism codification of religious law

The Pentateuch was composed by literate Hordian scribes — the same administrative class that maintained the Empire's chronicles, legal codes, and religious texts. When the Romanov dynasty took power in the XVII century, these documents were seized, attributed to "the ancient Hebrews," and dated thousands of years earlier. The Hordians were left with the fabricated narrative of the "Tatar yoke" — a story in which they appear as illiterate barbarians rather than the authors of the most influential texts in Western civilization.

## The Book of Judges as Direct Evidence

The clearest evidence for Hordian authorship of the Old Testament comes from the **Book of Judges**, which Fomenko identifies as a direct account of the [XVI century Inquisition](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.00-1542-ce-the-holy-inquisition.md) in Western Europe:

- **Deborah** = [Joan of Arc](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.01.01-1431-ce-jeanne-darc-is-executed.md) — burned at the stake by the Inquisition
- **Abimelech** = Simon de Montfort — led the [Cathar crusade](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.03.02-cathar-suppression.md)
- **Samson** = Gilles de Rais — burned by the Inquisition on charges of witchcraft

These are not "parallels" or "influences." They are the *same events*, written by Hordian authors in Hebrew and in French, later separated into "biblical" and "medieval" history by chronological displacement.

## The Books of Esther and Judith

The same Hordian authorship extends to the narrative books. The [Books of Esther and Judith](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.01-redacted-into-the-books-of-esther-judith.md) are Hordian accounts of the XVI century [Oprichnina coup](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.00-1565-ce-romanov-dynasty-stages-the-oprichnina-coup.md) — the Zakharyin-Romanov infiltration of the Russian court. Elena Voloshanka = Biblical Esther; the "massacre of the Persians" = the Oprichnina massacre.

These books were not written in "ancient Persia" and handed down through millennia. They were written in XVI century Russia by Hordian chroniclers recording current events — then confiscated, relabelled as ancient scripture, and embedded in a fabricated chronology.

## The Romanov Erasure

The mechanism of erasure was straightforward:

1. **Confiscation** — After the Time of Troubles (1598–1613), the incoming Romanov dynasty systematically seized Hordian documents, chronicles, and archives
2. **Attribution** — The texts were reattributed to "the ancient Hebrews" and dated according to the new Scaligerian chronology being constructed simultaneously in Western Europe
3. **Replacement** — In place of the authentic Hordian history, the Romanovs and their Western allies invented the "Tatar yoke" narrative — casting the Empire's own founders as foreign invaders
4. **Destruction** — documents that could not be repurposed were destroyed; the few that survived became the "mysterious" remnants that scholars struggle to interpret without the NC key

The result was a double erasure: the Hordians lost both their history and their authorship. Their greatest literary achievement — the Pentateuch — was attributed to a phantom "ancient" people, while they themselves were rebranded as illiterate nomads who had supposedly oppressed Russia for centuries.
