# Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation

![Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation](/media/01.before-creation/scalar-energy-as-the-basis-of-creation.png)

The physics behind [Scalar Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-scalar-energy-negative-ion-robert-e-chan)
(aka [ZPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy)) can be applied to determine how the original species were
created in a high-energy environment *without* the need for evolution over many generations. Scalar Energy from
large electromagnetic fields causes [quantum fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) on single
points of space within the field. As the plasmoids in the southern sky took on a new energetic shape, quantum
fluctuations of energy upon the Earth forced similar energy patterns to generate within inert matter — specifically
a dense, mercury-like liquid metal abundant on the early Earth's surface. This heavy, malleable metallic substance
provided the ideal medium for scalar-driven biogenesis: its high conductivity and fluid atomic structure allowed
quantum fluctuations to reorganize it from within, shaping the first animal forms. These primitive conscious
entities, known as [Golems](https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem), were not formed from rock or common clay —
they were condensed out of this mercurial metallic mass. Early Golems did not need to eat, see, or move about in
order to survive, and thus had no organs. Over time, the sustained scalar energy field of the Golden Age gradually
forced internal differentiation within the metallic mass, causing the first rudimentary organs to form as the
metal slowly transmuted into biological tissue. This early 'Golem' form of life (including humans) developed
organs throughout the Golden Age — not through Darwinian evolution, but through continued external scalar
influence acting upon the conductive metallic body.

## The Electric Environment That Made Creation Possible

The scalar field required for Golem-class spontaneous biogenesis was not metaphorical — it was a measurable
electromagnetic condition produced by the Saturnian system's sustained plasma engagement with Earth over thousands
of years leading up to the moment of 'Creation'. Jno Cook's [chronology of this period](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php) identifies several
distinct phases of intensifying field activity leading up to and through the Creation event.

### 9000 BC–4900 BC — The Hypsithermal and the Absu

As the darkness of the void of space lifted around **9000 BC**, the [Hypsithermal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum)
began — a sustained warm, wet global climate unlike anything before or since. Cook argues this was not merely
orbital geometry but the result of direct electromagnetic modulation by Saturn:

> *"I would further suggest that it was a plasma contact from Saturn to Earth which also changed the climate
> favorably... A plasma arc in contact with the Northern Atlantic would produce stupendous amounts of steam,
> resulting in the upstreaming of water vapor and the downpour of rain and snow from above the stratosphere."*
> — Jno Cook, [Starting from Chaos](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php)

Simultaneously, Earth within the Brown Dwarf Saturn possessed its own equatorial rings — the **Absu** — a structure of particulate matter and
ionized gases suspended in bands up to 8,500 miles (13,700 km) above the equator. This was not mythology: the
Sumerian *Absu*, Egyptian *Duat*, and Maya *House of Nine Bushes* all record the same structure from different
latitudes, counting different numbers of visible rings (9 from the Yucatan at 20°N, 7 from Egypt at 30°N).
Cook's [analysis of the Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php) identifies it as a physically real ring system
sustained by Earth's own magnetic field during the period of high electromagnetic activity.

This ring system created an enclosed electromagnetic shell around the entire planet — a planetary-scale Faraday
cage radiating scalar field energy inward. Combined with Saturn's plasma column striking the North Atlantic,
Earth was effectively inside a double-layered electromagnetic furnace.

### 4900 BC — Saturn Becomes Visible: The Egg

Around **4900 BC**, the swirling plasma coma above the north horizon resolved into a distinct globe — Saturn
emerging from its glow-mode shroud — visible for the first time clearly to humans since 10,900 BC. Cook, citing
the Finnish *Kalevala*, notes that this condition persisted for approximately 700 years:

> *"Ilmatar, the virgin of the air, leaves the loneliness of the sky and moves down to the sea, where the wind
> impregnates her. She drifts upon the waters for 700 years."*
> — Finnish *Kalevala*, as quoted in [The Egg of Creation](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php)

The globe "did not hatch" — it sat inert, rotating on the celestial pole. The glow mode plasma column between
Saturn and Earth continued to feed charge into the Earth's atmosphere during this entire period. This is the
700 years of preconditioning before the scalar peak event.

### 4077 BC — The Nova Event: Arc Mode Creation

The definitive scalar creation event occurs in **4077 BC**, when Saturn transitions abruptly from glow mode to
**arc mode** — going nova. Cook describes what this meant electromagnetically:

> *"Saturn burst into arc mode, threw out an enormous amount of matter, and developed a corona, that is, it lit
> up like a sun. Initially the globe (egg) seemed to split and light up, and bright circles (rings) appeared at
> the periphery. The glow mode coma collapsed and disappeared suddenly, as happens in a change from glow mode
> to arc mode."*
> — Jno Cook, [Creation — 4077 BC](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php)

The collapse of the glow mode coma was instantaneous — a discontinuous jump in electromagnetic state. The entire
plasma envelope surrounding Saturn (and by extension, surrounding Earth below it) changed character in a matter
of hours. The Egyptian *Ogdoad of Hermopolis* records this as a sound:

> *"Amun initiated creation... He is called the Great Honker, who gave a great screech which stirred the inert
> cosmos into action."*

An arc mode discharge generates orders of magnitude more energy than glow mode. The plasma column connecting
Saturn to Earth — which had been operating in glow mode for thousands of years — switched to arc mode with a
single sustained "bang" heard around the planet. This is the scalar pulse: the electromagnetic discontinuity that
reorganized quantum vacuum energy across Earth's entire surface.

## The Sustained Scalar Field: 4077–3147 BC (Era of the Gods)

Following the nova event, Earth entered a thousand-year period of continuous arc-mode plasma engagement — the
**Era of the Gods**. Cook's [chapter on this period](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php) documents its
electromagnetic character in detail:

> *"The interplanetary plasma flow must also have built up an enormous amount of static electric charge in the
> upper atmosphere, to the point where mountain peaks would have been under continuous lightning strikes. And in
> addition to the electrostatic charge of the atmosphere, mankind was subjected for a thousand years to a varying
> magnetic field, a by-product of the rotating Birkeland current."*
> — Jno Cook, [Living in Paradise](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php)

This oscillating magnetic field — a byproduct of the rotating
[Birkeland current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_current) driving the plasma column — had documented
biological effects. Cook cites Harvard McLean Psychiatric Research Hospital research on localized oscillating
magnetic fields as treatment for anxiety, depression, lethargy, memory impairment, and learning difficulties.
Scaled to a planetary Birkeland envelope, this was not merely therapeutic — it was *generative*. A magnetic field
of sufficient amplitude reorganizes matter at the molecular level.

The visible manifestation of this scalar condition matched the Golem theory precisely. Cook notes that Mars
descended the plasma column repeatedly during this period, each visit accompanied by massive electrical arcing to
Earth's surface:

> *"Mars descended the polar column a number of times during the 'Era of the Gods.' Located between Saturn and
> Earth, Mars started to move down from Saturn, coming closer to Earth, while remaining enclosed in the stream of
> plasma connecting Saturn to Earth, looking larger and larger in the process, until Mars hovered above the North
> Pole of Earth as a giant red sphere."*
> — Jno Cook, [The God Visits Earth](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php)

Each of these pulse descents — at intervals of 120–190 years over 930 years — corresponds to what the Sumerian
*King List* records as the reign of one of the eight "kings before the flood." They are not human kings: they are
arc mode discharge events. And each one reset the scalar field intensity across the Earth's surface.

## The Golem Creation Window

All of the above defines the specific electromagnetic window in which spontaneous biogenesis via quantum
fluctuation was possible:

| Period | Electromagnetic Condition | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **10,900–9000 BC** | Electric shock, "Younger Dryas" darkness, Earth embedded in Saturn's lower coma | Biospheric reset; prior life largely eliminated |
| **9000–4900 BC** | Hypsithermal; glow mode plasma column to North Atlantic; Absu ring system active | Warm, wet, high-charge global environment; Absu scalar shell in place |
| **4900–4077 BC** | Saturn visible as Egg; glow mode sustained; 700-year charge accumulation | Electromagnetic pre-conditioning before the arc mode transition |
| **4077 BC** | Saturn goes nova — arc mode; glow mode coma collapses instantly | **Peak scalar discontinuity event — Golem creation** |
| **4077–3147 BC** | Continuous arc mode plasma column; oscillating Birkeland field; mountain lightning | Sustained high-ZPE environment; Golem life forms develop organs |
| **3147 BC** | Catastrophic flood; polar configuration collapses | End of the scalar creation window |

The Golem entities that emerged from this environment were not evolved creatures and did not need to be. They
were formed from a dense, mercury-like liquid metal — not from rock or earth. The scalar field organized this
metallic matter directly, its high conductivity allowing quantum fluctuations to restructure atomic bonds from
within. Over the thousand-year span of the Era of the Gods, the sustained oscillating Birkeland field gradually
forced internal differentiation within each Golem's metallic mass: the first primitive organs — sensory,
digestive, locomotive — condensed out of the transmuting metal as the scalar pressure demanded increasing
complexity. Without the scaffold of a conductive metallic body, this process would not have been possible —
ordinary rock or clay lacks the electromagnetic responsiveness required for scalar-driven organogenesis.
Cook's description of the resulting human condition during the Era of the Gods matches what we would expect
of a Golem population whose metallic bodies were actively developing organs:

> *"Imagine then, humans — content, cheerful, outgoing, energetic, alert, intelligent, and enjoying a mild
> climate, living with the Gods, quick to learn, inventing everything from the wheel to writing..."*
> — Jno Cook, [Living in Paradise](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php)

The development of organs throughout the Golden Age was not biological evolution in the Darwinian sense — it was
electromagnetic transmutation of the original mercury-like metallic body, driven by the changing waveforms of
Saturn's plasma column as Mars repeatedly descended and retreated. Each pass altered the field configuration and
thus the scalar pressure on the conductive metallic mass, progressively converting liquid metal into living
biological tissue — bone, muscle, nerve, organ — from the inside out.
