# Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation

The physics behind [Scalar Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-scalar-energy-negative-ion-robert-e-chan)
(aka [ZPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy)) can be applied to determine how the original species were
created in a high-energy environment *without* the need for evolution over many generations. Scalar Energy from
large electromagnetic fields causes [quantum fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) on single
points of space within the field. As the plasmoids in the southern sky took on a new energetic shape, quantum
fluctuations of energy upon the Earth forced similar energy patterns to generate within the inert matter (raw material
like metal or clay), and thus bringing the first animal forms to life. These primitive conscious entities, known as
[Golems](https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem) did not need to eat, see, or move about, in order to survive and thus
had no organs. This early 'Golem' form of life (including humans) then evolved organs throughout the Golden Age
as necessary.
