# Historical Christ is Born in _Crimea_

Christ's mother (Katya) was one of those attempting to flee the census. She made it as far as Crimea before
being caught. However, the locals of Crimea took pity on her as she was moaning in pain with a difficult pregnancy. The
language barrier prevented the humans from asking Katya who the father was, and many assumed she was a prostitute, or a
virgin. It's possible her husband was killed by smaller humans, and she *simply refused to talk* about it. She couldn't
fit inside the buildings and had to be put in a horse stable where the locals performed a cesarean section. According
to [eastern chronicles](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_18.html), the difficult procedure resulted in
the stabbing of the infant Christ while still in the womb leading to the
[Holy Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance)
and [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail).
Eventually the local authorities agreed to let the giants live, as long as they were Baptized and inducted into
Monotheism.

Christ later traveled with his family to Jerusalem in Istanbul where he trained as a Rabbi. In Jerusalem, rabbis would
endlessly deliberate to bridge the gap between ancient Monotheism and the eclectic polytheistic indigenous religions of
the east they were trying to subsume. This strategy backfired as Christ and his mother Katya remained unconvinced of
the Church’s conclusions and authority deferring instead to the eastern belief systems Katya was raised in.
As a result of Christ's [clerical criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple), his
family was driven out of Jerusalem. The Gospel of Matthew contains a redacted version of this true story in the
[escape of the Holy Family](https://www.memphistours.com/Egypt/WikiTravel/History-Egypt/wiki/Holy-Family-in-Egypt) from
King Herod to Egypt, when in eastern records they were fleeing the persecution in Istanbul back
to their home in central Asia - what would later become the Rus-Horde Empire.

After arriving safely at home, Christ developed a following based on his hybridized religious teachings. The religion of
Christianity formed around a series of parables as he demonstrated that people are born free from mental and physical
slavery and don’t need to obey the Church or any God. This following spread quickly back to Istanbul, and once again
challenged the foundations of Monotheism. The Deep State reacted - laying plans to capture him and neutralize his
influence. He was invited to a passover celebration in Jerusalem, where he was promptly arrested, put on trial, and
crucified. The charge against him was insurrection, but not for *challenging Monotheism*, but rather - he was
accused of being the *King* of the Monotheists (Jews), a claim he never made.
The Monotheists hated Christ and his reform movement so much they refused to mention his name for the next 200 years,
at which point they accepted his popularity and retroactively named him the Savior of Mankind, the Messiah,
and *the Je-Zeus* merging the 'pagan' historical Christ with their old hellenistic savior-Zeus i.e. Son of God.
