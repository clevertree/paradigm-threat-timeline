# The Dark Ages

The period of stability that pervaded the Golden Age would suddenly come to an end. Each planet had been absorbing matter
and energy from the Sun growing in size throughout the *Golden Age* period. Eventually the planets become too large and
too energetic, and begin to oscillate violently in a new non-linear orbit beginning a long period of instability that
would come to define the *Dark Ages*.
