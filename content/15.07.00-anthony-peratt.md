## Primary Contribution

Laboratory plasma physics confirmation of the ancient polar aurora as a Z-pinch event recorded in petroglyphs worldwide. Anthony Peratt is a plasma physicist from Los Alamos National Laboratory and a student of Hannes Alfvén. His research began in plasma physics but shifted to archaeoastronomy after he noticed that ancient petroglyphs worldwide depicted patterns identical to those produced in laboratory high-current Z-pinch plasma discharge experiments.

## Central Contribution: Petroglyphs as Plasma Records

- **Over 100 distinct petroglyph types** found on every inhabited continent map precisely to specific phases of Z-pinch plasma discharge: the "squatting man" (stickman), columnar stacks, dot-in-circle, concentric ring motifs
- **The 3 southern plasmoids** — Peratt's 2003 paper identified three plasma columns in the ancient southern sky corresponding to Mercury, Neptune, and Uranus in the Saturnian lower configuration (the southern hemisphere squatting-man configuration)
- **Quantitative dating** — plasma intensities required to produce the observed petroglyph patterns provide a physical constraint on when the event occurred
- **Location geometry** — the angle of incidence of petroglyph imagery relative to the horizon matches predictions for specific latitudes, confirming a common celestial source

> *"Part I deals with the comparison of graphical and radiation data from high current Z-pinches to petroglyphs, geo-glyphs, and megaliths. Part II focuses on the source of light and its temporal change from a current-increasing Z-pinch or dense-plasma-focus aurora."*
