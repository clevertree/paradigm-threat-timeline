# Christ's family flees ahead of the census

At the same time, the Deep State prioritized the *conversion* of giants into Monotheism (if at all possible). They saw
the Baptism of the giant Andronicus Christ as a unique opportunity to spread their influence east. With the census, many
giants were fleeing the Istanbul region knowing what the census would mean for them if they stayed put - and many giants
were killed en route.

*Christ was a hairy human giant. Here is a painting of his hairy giant mother from the Body and Soul exhibit in Italy. "I went to see the exhibition 'Body and Soul: Sculpture in Italy from Donatello to Michelangelo,' and this was the first I had ever heard of the miraculous body hair of Mary Magdalene! I mean, what? I guess Christians already knew about this? That she's supposed to have lived in the desert until her clothes crumbled away, then her own body hair miraculously grew to clothe her? Why hasn't this found its way into a short story I've read? Did everyone just know this already?" — [@summerbrennan](https://twitter.com/summerbrennan/status/1406610171934224386)*
