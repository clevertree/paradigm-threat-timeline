# Wal Thornhill

![Wal Thornhill](/media/00.overview/wal-thornhill.png)

**Wallace "Wal" Thornhill** (1942–2023) was an Australian physicist and independent researcher, and the
principal theorist of the [Electric Universe](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/eu-guide/)
model. Born in Melbourne during the Second World War, he spent more than five decades building a coherent
alternative cosmology grounded in plasma physics, classical electromagnetism, and the cross-disciplinary
study of ancient testimony. He died on **February 7, 2023**.

The [Thunderbolts Project](https://www.thunderbolts.info) — the organization he co-founded with David Talbott
— paid tribute on his passing:

> *"RIP master Wal Thornhill. You opened our eyes. You have been a giant in your time.*
> *'We need something better, the electric universe is the something better.'*
> *Tears of sadness for your passing and of joy for your life."*

## Biography

Thornhill was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1942. His father was invalided during the Second World War
and the family lived modestly on a pension. An uncle — a commando veteran of New Guinea — introduced him
to the telescope and to shortwave radio, instilling a lifelong curiosity about how things worked. He taught
himself to build crystal radio sets and sold them to classmates at school.

At high school his father brought home a red-covered book from the military hospital: **[*Worlds in
Collision*](https://archive.org/details/worldsincollisio00veli) by Immanuel Velikovsky** (1950). Thornhill
had never seen the scientific method applied so broadly across disciplines. Worlds in Collision argued that
the ancient skies were radically different from those we see today and that electromagnetic forces dominated
the solar system during the historic period of planetary chaos. The book became the intellectual catalyst
for everything that followed.

At university, Thornhill was the only physics undergraduate haunting the anthropology library stacks,
checking whether Velikovsky had cherry-picked his sources. He concluded Velikovsky had made a genuinely
strong case that could not be dismissed. Lectures offered either hostility or evasion when questioned on
the subject. He completed his degree, began postgraduate research in upper atmosphere physics at the
University of Melbourne, then left academia to join IBM during the early Wild West years of computing —
where he developed the habit of refusing to treat anything as a black box.

In **1979**, shortly before Velikovsky's death, Thornhill visited him at his home in Princeton to discuss
the electrical nature of gravity. Velikovsky gave him a slim, early manuscript he had written in the 1930s:
*Cosmos without Gravitation* — which Thornhill regarded as pointing toward the single deepest problem
with the mainstream account of celestial mechanics.

## The Electric Universe Framework

Thornhill's core proposition, developed across decades of presentations and papers, is that **electricity
and plasma are the dominant forces governing the behavior of stars, planets, comets, and large-scale
cosmic structure** — not gravity acting on electrically neutral matter.

In his own words, from the *Interdisciplinary Story of the EU* lecture:

> *"The Electric Universe operates by trying to imagine what those original simple rules were, and the
> result of that has been a synthesis which allows us to get a grasp on how the Universe really works in
> an electrical sense. It's very simple — you could teach this to primary school students."*

His framework draws directly on the Nobel Prize-winning plasma physicist
[Hannes Alfvén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n), who warned in his 1970 Nobel acceptance
speech that an inevitable crisis in astrophysics would follow if electric circuits in space were not
recognized. Thornhill spent the next fifty years vindicated by each new crisis in mainstream cosmology.

Key principles:

- **The electric sun:** The Sun is not powered by internal thermonuclear fusion but by external
   electric discharge from interstellar currents — a model independently tested in the
   [SAFIRE plasma reactor experiment](https://www.safireproject.com/), which Thornhill considered
   direct laboratory confirmation that astrophysicists do not correctly understand stellar energy.
- **Electric gravity:** Gravity is not a separate, mysterious force but is an emergent electromagnetic
   phenomenon arising from the charge distribution within matter. Thornhill traced this insight to his
   1981 discovery of Ralph Sansbury's *Journal of Classical Physics* and its treatment of electron
   structure — arguing that point-particle mathematics had broken physics circa 1900 and that the
   classical approach was the only way back.
- **Comets are electric:** Comet tails, coma, x-ray emissions, and surface features are products of
   electric discharge between the comet (a negatively charged rocky body) and the solar wind, not
   sublimating ice. Before the 2005 [Deep Impact](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/deep-impact)
   mission, Thornhill published specific, testable predictions: the impact would reveal rock, not
   dirty snowball — no ice. The surface material found was consistent with rocky, dry composition and
   included unexpected x-ray bursts, both matching his predictions.
- **Birkeland current formation:** Stars and planets do not form by gravitational collapse from
   diffuse gas clouds over billions of years. From his *Saturn-Earth Connection* lecture:

   > *"In our Electric Universe, stars and planets are formed at the same time inside molecular
   > clouds along a snaking cosmic lightning bolt."*

   These snaking lightning bolts are [Birkeland currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_current),
   the filamentary plasma structures that carry electric charge across cosmic distances and organize
   matter into stars and planets simultaneously.

## The Saturn-Earth Connection

Thornhill's most historically significant contribution — developed in collaboration with
[Dave Talbott](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/authors/dave-talbott/) and
[Dwardu Cardona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwardu_Cardona) — is the model of Saturn as a former
[brown dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf) star that once occupied the center of a
collinear planetary configuration with Earth.

From his *Saturn-Earth Connection* presentation:

> *"The history and origins of the gas giant Saturn, and indeed the entire solar system, including our
> own planet, is not what we've been told."*

Key claims of this model:

- **Saturn as host star:** Proto-Earth was captured by Saturn when Saturn was a brown dwarf drifting
   through interstellar space, outside the influence of our Sun. Saturn served as Earth's original
   host star, providing light, warmth, and electromagnetic organization.
- **Water from Saturn:** The water now in Earth's oceans originated from Saturn's violent plasma
   flare-up as the brown dwarf was captured into the Sun's orbit. Watery filaments rained onto Earth
   during this catastrophic event — a claim Thornhill derived from Velikovsky and subsequently
   confirmed (in his view) by the discovery that water in Saturn's rings and satellites is
   chemically remarkably similar to Earth's ocean water.
- **Polar configuration:** In the Golden Age, Earth, Mars, and Venus were stacked in axial alignment
   with Saturn at the pole — visible to ancient observers as the spectacular Wheel of Heaven.
- **The Great Catastrophe:** The eventual breakup of this collinear configuration produced the
   cataclysms recorded in mythologies worldwide under the names of gods doing battle, which Talbott
   and Thornhill analyzed in the documentary
   [*Symbols of an Alien Sky*](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/resources/dvd-blu-ray/symbols-of-an-alien-sky/) (2009)
   and [*The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars*](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/resources/dvd-blu-ray/the-lightning-scarred-planet-mars/) (2012).

## On the JWST and Crises in Modern Cosmology

In one of his final major presentations, recorded for the Thunderbolts channel on the
[James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/webb) and L-type brown dwarf stars, Thornhill
addressed the growing emergency in Big Bang cosmology:

> *"The SAFIRE plasma experiment proved that astrophysicists don't understand stars and their source
> of radiant energy."*

> *"The creation stories tell of the establishment of the present sky following a period of apocalyptic
> chaos. Rationally, those stories can have nothing to do with the creation of the universe. The solar
> system has a frightful recent history that is essential to grasp before we have any hope of
> understanding exoplanetary systems, ourselves, or life in the universe."*

He described the *New Scientist* headline of December 1, 2021 — *"Is our solar system a cosmic
oddity? Evidence from exoplanets says yes"* — as corroboration that mainstream solar system formation
models had become a "fairy tale," and that only EU-based plasma cosmology could explain why our system
looks anomalous compared to every other planetary system observed.

## On Specialization as the Enemy of Science

A recurring theme across Thornhill's presentations is the institutional failure of specialization:

> *"Today specialization is the enemy of science. It produces more complication than simplification
> because experts mislead each other with things, as Tom said: 'they don't know they don't know.'
> The result is a useless reflection in a shattered mirror."*

> *"Mathematics isn't physics."*

He cited [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) on gravity — "There is no
model of the theory of gravitation today, other than the mathematical form" — and
[Martin Rees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees) — "What causes gravity and mass? These
questions still baffle all of us... we are still near the beginning of the cosmic quest" — as
inadvertent admissions that mainstream physics had traded explanation for calculation.

## Significance for This Timeline

Thornhill's Saturn-Earth model is the primary scientific framework underlying the
[Before Creation](/content/01.00.00-5000-bce-before-creation.md) chapter of this timeline. His insistence
that the creation myths of all civilizations describe *real, identifiable astronomical events* from
human memory — not metaphysics, not allegory, not imagination — is what makes a timeline like this
possible at all. Without the Electric Universe framework, Fomenko's compressed chronology and the
Saturnian cosmological record cannot be physically explained.

Thornhill never, to date, stated the [Short Cosmic Life Cycle](/content/00.01.03-cosmic-life-cycle.md)
theory explicitly — the claim that Solar Systems undergo repeated birth-death-rebirth cycles and that
the "Big Bang" in ancient testimony refers to the *rebirth* of our Solar System rather than the
origin of the Universe. However, his model of planet formation from Birkeland currents, his Saturn
brown dwarf model, and his assertion that the entire Solar System has a "frightful recent history"
are fully consistent with that framework, and are among its strongest supporting pillars.
