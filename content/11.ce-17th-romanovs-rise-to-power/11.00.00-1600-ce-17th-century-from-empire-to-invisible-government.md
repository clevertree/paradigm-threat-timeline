# 17th Century: From Empire to Invisible Government

The 17th century is the hinge of modern history — the century in which **visible empire** was replaced by **invisible government**. At its start, a single world-ruling dynasty still controlled the administrative, military, and financial infrastructure of the largest empire in human history. By its end, that empire had been fractured into dozens of competing nation-states, its treasury had been moved to London and placed under centralized banking control, and the entity that had orchestrated the entire transformation had made itself invisible.

This chapter traces that transformation through six interconnected theatres of operation:

![King James Bible](/media/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/king_james_bible.jpg)
*The [King James Only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Only_movement) movement asserts that the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is superior to all other translations. The KJV was published in 1611 — two years before the Romanovs seized the throne — as one of several coordinated cultural weapons deployed against the old Imperial order.*

## I. The Romanov Seizure (1611-1627)

The [Romanov seizure](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.00-1611-ce-the-romanov-seizure-and-fracturing-of-the-empire.md) of Moscow in 1613, preceded by the publication of the King James Bible (1611) and followed by Petavius's wholesale rewriting of world chronology (1627), constituted the political destruction of the Hordian world-empire. The "Time of Troubles" (1598–1613) was not a spontaneous crisis but a managed destabilization. The legitimate heirs were murdered or exiled. The Cossack Horde was expelled to the periphery — the regions they settled still bear their name: Kazakhstan = Cossack-Stan.

## II. Resistance and Religious Wars (1618-1660)

The fracturing did not go unopposed. The [Thirty Years' War](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.02.00-1618-ce-resistance-and-religious-wars.md) (1618–1648), the English Civil War (1642–1651), the Cossack–Polish War (1648), and the deliberate instigation of 300 years of Russo-Turkish conflict were all consequences of — or responses to — the Empire's destruction. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) was not a peace treaty but a carve-up agreement, making it institutionally illegal for any power to attempt reunification.

## III. The Marfull Framework: Mediterranean Realignment

The [Marfull chronological framework](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.03.00-the-marfull-framework-mediterranean-realignment.md) provides a parallel reconstruction of the Mediterranean theatre: inter-religious disputes (1633–1679), the fall of the Avignon papacy, the dismantling of the Templar order (equation: 1307 = 1492 = 1677), and the Catalan-Aragonese military campaigns. These events represent the southern front of the same global restructuring.

## IV. London 1664-1694: The Financial Coup

The [London financial coup](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.00-1664-ce-london-1664-1694-the-financial-coup.md) is the **keystone** of this chapter: a thirty-year sequence — comet (1664), plague (1664-66), fire (1666), Dutch attack (1667), the Cabal (1668-74), the Stop of the Exchequer (1672), the Bank of England (1694) — that transferred all financial power from the independent goldsmith class to a centralized banking monopoly. The goldsmiths' ability to independently appraise gold threatened the royal currency; the Bank of England's monopoly on banknotes made independent valuation illegal. This was the start of real-world poverty, the likes of which had never been seen on Earth.

## V. Jesuit Global Operations

The [Jesuit missionary program](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.05.00-jesuit-global-operations-in-the-17th-century.md) in Asia — particularly the conversion of Asian populations to Buddhism — extended the reach of the post-Imperial religious order to its furthest point.

## VI. The British Empire as Pyramidal Empire Instrument

The [British Empire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.06.00-1583-ce-the-british-empire-as-deep-state-instrument.md) (1583–1997) was not a conventional empire. It conquered, divided populations on racial markers, armed both sides, left, and collected the profits of the resulting civil wars. The British people never benefited. The NWO iconography — London, D.C., Vatican, Latin — is evidence that the Empire was an instrument of non-British (and perhaps non-human) control.

## The Thesis

The 17th century began with a world-empire and ended with a world-bank. The empire was visible — its armies marched, its emperors sat on thrones, its borders were drawn on maps. The bank was invisible — its shareholders were anonymous, its authority derived from royal charter rather than military conquest, and its control extended over every nation-state that adopted its model of centralized monetary authority.

Every major power structure that governs the world today — central banking, the nation-state system, the Westphalian principle of sovereignty, the Anglican/Protestant religious framework, the Jesuit educational network — was either created or consolidated in the 17th century. The question this chapter raises is whether these structures emerged organically from human political competition, or whether they were installed by a coordinating intelligence that transferred its method of control from the visible (empire) to the invisible (finance).
