# Deep State solidifies central banking

Charles II implements William Paterson's plan for a new [centralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England)
type of bank. The ‘Governor and the Company of the Bank of England’ was established by royal charter to operate as a
joint-stock company with limited liability with share-holders. Other joint-stock banks would not be permitted to issue
banknotes, giving the Bank of England a significant competitive advantage. 1, 268 different people jumped on the scheme
and raised £1.2 million in just 11 days in exchange for 8 % interest. The Bank itself was established in an old Roman
Temple on Walbrook street in London, where [Mithras](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mithraism), the Roman god of
contracts, was worshiped.
