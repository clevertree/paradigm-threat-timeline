# The Dutch Burn the English Fleet (1667)

In June 1667, during the [Raid on the Medway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_the_Medway), the Dutch Republic's navy sailed up the Thames estuary and into the River Medway, broke through the chain protecting the English fleet, burned or captured several major warships, and towed away the *Royal Charles* — the flagship that had carried Charles II home for his Restoration just seven years earlier. It was the worst military humiliation in English naval history.

The immediate political consequence was the dismissal and exile of the [Earl of Clarendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon), Charles II's chief minister, who was blamed for the disaster. This created the vacuum that would be filled by [the Cabal](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.07-1668-ce-the-cabal-englands-shadow-cabinet.md) — the five non-Anglican ministers who would govern England through Charles for the next six years.

> *"The Great Plague of London (1664–66) and the Great Fire of London (1666) were interpreted as divine judgments against a sinful nation. These catastrophes were compounded when the Dutch burned a large portion of the English fleet in 1667, which led to the dismissal and exile of Clarendon."* — [Britannica, "The Later Stuarts"](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/The-later-Stuarts)

## A Rival Puppet, Not a Deep State Operation

I interpret this incident as a **rival puppet European aristocracy taking advantage of a moment of weakness** in Britain's rulership, having little to do with any deep state theory. The Dutch Republic — itself the product of the same Reformation that had fractured the Hordian Empire — was a competing state with its own interests, its own aristocracy, and its own ambitions.

People were not aware of any deep state or cabal operating behind the scenes. We were like **insects under a microscope** — we can see the glass, but everything beyond it is a blur. We see many moments of weakness in history — especially in modern history, where civil war or self-sabotage from the highest levels of leadership leaves nations temporarily vulnerable — and we also see other countries stepping in to take advantage.

The pattern repeats: China invaded Vietnam on [February 17, 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War), exploiting the aftermath of the Vietnam War and Vietnam's intervention in Cambodia. Argentina seized the Falkland Islands in 1982 during a period of perceived British weakness. Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 when he calculated that international attention was elsewhere. In 1667, the Dutch saw an England ravaged by plague, devastated by fire, and politically divided — and they struck.

This does not make the Dutch attack part of a larger conspiracy. It makes it part of human nature: when a rival is weakened, opportunists advance. The *consequences* of the attack, however, served the Deep State's interests perfectly — removing Clarendon and opening space for the Cabal. Whether this was foreseen or merely exploited after the fact is an open question.
