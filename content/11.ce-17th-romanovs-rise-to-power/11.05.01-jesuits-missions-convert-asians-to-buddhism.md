# Jesuits Missions convert Asians to Buddhism

The 17th century was the century of maximum Jesuit ambition — and maximum resistance. Having established footholds in the Americas ([15th century](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.04.00-jesuit-operations-conversion-and-catholicism.md)) and Africa/Middle East ([16th century](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.02.00-1523-ce-jesuits-make-pilgrimage-to-palestine.md)), the Society of Jesus turned to **Asia**.

The mission to convert eastern *Gnostic* Christians into western Catholics proved impossible. Asian communities had detailed records of Christ — their first Emperor — spanning centuries after his death, with no record of him being a god's son. Furthermore, they rejected monotheism entirely. The Jesuits fell back on assimilating their saviour myth into a different popular character: [The Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism). Fomenko summarizes [the strategy](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html):

> The idea is to improve the icon of Jesus by assimilating it to the Buddha… Buddha and Jesus have similar biographies, because they are the fruit of a common project.

## Japan: Complete Rejection

The [Tokugawa shogunate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku)'s expulsion of Christianity represents the most successful resistance to the Jesuit strategy anywhere. Christianity gained a foothold through [Francis Xavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Xavier) (arrived 1549); by the early 1600s about 300,000 had converted. Beginning in 1614, increasingly severe persecution culminated in the [Shimabara Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimabara_rebellion) (1637–38) — an uprising of largely Christian peasants crushed with ~37,000 killed. Japan closed to Western contact under [Sakoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku) policy until 1853.

Missionary deaths — the [26 Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26_Martyrs_of_Japan) (1597), the [Great Martyrdom of Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Martyrdom) (1622) — became European propaganda, but Japan's institutional memory of its Hordian connections was strong enough to recognize and reject the Jesuit project entirely.

## China: The Court Astronomers

In China, Jesuits achieved what they couldn't in Japan: court access. [Matteo Ricci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Ricci) (1552–1610) won Imperial favour through astronomy and cartography. By the 17th century, [Johann Adam Schall von Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Adam_Schall_von_Bell) and [Ferdinand Verbiest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Verbiest) directed the Imperial Astronomical Bureau — literally controlling the Chinese calendar.

But the [Chinese Rites controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Rites_controversy) — whether Chinese Catholics could continue Confucian ancestor veneration — torpedoed the mission. In 1724, the [Yongzheng Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongzheng_Emperor) banned Christian proselytization and expelled missionaries. Another centralized Asian state had recognized the threat and shut it down.

## Southeast Asia and India

[Roberto de Nobili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_de_Nobili) (1577–1656) pioneered *inculturation* in India — dressing as a Brahmin, studying Sanskrit. The Philippines (under Spanish control) was the easiest target; Vietnam proved more resistant.

## The Martyr Pattern

Across every Asian theatre, missionaries were killed following the same pattern: peaceful arrival, trust-building, conversion pressure, death at the hands of communities recognizing the existential threat, and death publicized as evidence of Asian "barbarism." Each martyrdom created moral grounds for military intervention. The missionaries always took the punishment; the empire used their suffering as moral currency. See [Jesuit Restoration](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.05.00-1814-ce-the-jesuit-restoration-and-the-missionary-military-pattern.md).

## Buddhism and the NC Framework

The NC observation that Buddhism and Christianity share biographical structures — miraculous births, temptation narratives, teaching careers, symbolic deaths — is not coincidence but design. Both figures are expressions of the same Imperial religious archetype — the Christ-Andronicus figure of the 12th century — adapted for different provincial audiences.
