# Jesuits Missions convert Asians to Buddhism

The 17th century was the century of maximum Jesuit ambition — and maximum resistance. Having established footholds in the Americas ([15th century](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.04.00-jesuit-operations-conversion-and-catholicism.md)), Africa and the Middle East ([16th century](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.02.00-1523-ce-jesuits-make-pilgrimage-to-palestine.md)), the Society of Jesus turned to its most difficult target: **Asia**.

The success of the Jesuit missions in Europe, Africa, and America emboldened the Jesuits to target the last
remaining non-monotheistic indigenous religion left in the world — *Christianity*. In Western Europe, the Jesuits had
already *catharized* anyone associated with original Gnostic Christianity, but the Missionaries knew Asia would be more
difficult to conquer theologically and militarily.

The Jesuit mission to convert eastern *Gnostic* Christians into western Catholicism proved impossible. Any attempt to
proselytize Gnostics into the belief that Christ was the only *Son* of the *Creator God of the Universe* was met with
skepticism. Eastern Christians already had detailed records of Christ — their first Emperor and founder of the Rus-Horde
Empire — spanning hundreds of years after his death and certainly there was no record of Christ having been the son of a
god. Furthermore, the Jesuits failed to convince the Polytheistic Gnostics that there was a *Creator of the Universe* at
all. The Missionaries had to fall back on the next best plan — to *assimilate* their Monotheistic saviour myth into a
*different* popular character from the eastern pantheon — [The Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism).
Fomenko summarizes
[the strategy](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html):

> The idea is to improve the icon of Jesus by assimilating it to the Buddha, at the same time that a new Christian Bible
> is conceived and Jewish stigmatization begins with them. Buddha and Jesus have similar biographies, because they are
> the fruit of a common project, and it is desired to unite them. For this reason, Jesuits are initially well received
> in China and Japan, while there is an awareness of being a common project associated with the glory of the same
> lineage.

## The Strategic Context: Why Asia Last

The sequencing of the Jesuit missionary campaign was not random. Europe and the Americas were priority targets because they were former Hordian territory whose populations still maintained living connections to the old Imperial religious traditions. Once those populations were safely converted to the new Monotheistic/Catholic order, Asia could be approached — but only from a position of established Western supremacy, economic leverage, and military presence.

The Jesuit accommodation strategy in China (the [Chinese Rites controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Rites_controversy)) attempted to present Christianity as compatible with Confucian ancestor veneration, while simultaneously infiltrating the Imperial Chinese court as astronomers and advisors. The NC context: the Manchurian dynasty that ruled China from 1644 was itself descended from Hordian Mongolian conquerors — distant relatives of the same Imperial line the Romanovs had displaced in Russia. The Jesuits were attempting to penetrate one of the last surviving branches of the old Empire from the inside.

## The Fiercest Resistance: Asia Fights Back

The 17th century produced the most violent resistance to the Jesuit mission in the order's history. In Asia — unlike in the Americas or Africa — the Jesuits encountered civilizations with centralized states, written traditions, standing armies, and populations that recognized the Jesuit project for what it was.

### Japan: The Shimabara Rebellion and Two Centuries of Closure

The Tokugawa shogunate's violent expulsion of Christianity from Japan represents the most successful resistance to the Jesuit strategy anywhere in the world. Christianity had gained a foothold in Japan through Jesuit missionaries (most notably [Francis Xavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Xavier), who arrived in 1549), and by the early 1600s an estimated 300,000 Japanese had converted.

The Tokugawa regime recognized the threat. Beginning in 1614, increasingly severe persecution of Christians culminated in the [Shimabara Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimabara_rebellion) of 1637–1638 — an uprising of largely Christian peasants that was crushed with the deaths of approximately 37,000 rebels. After Shimabara, Japan was essentially closed to Western contact under the [Sakoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku) policy until [1853](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Kanagawa).

Missionaries who remained in Japan during this period were hunted, tortured, and killed. The [26 Martyrs of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26_Martyrs_of_Japan) (1597) and the [Great Martyrdom of Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Martyrdom) (1622) became famous in Europe — providing exactly the kind of propaganda the colonial pattern required. But Japan's institutional memory of its connections to the Hordian Empire was strong enough to recognize and reject the Jesuit project entirely. The country's two-century isolation was the result — the most successful quarantine against Western imperial expansion in history.

### China: The Court Astronomers

In China, the Jesuits achieved what they could not in Japan: access to the Imperial court itself. [Matteo Ricci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Ricci) (1552–1610) had established the beachhead in the late 16th century by presenting himself as a scholar rather than a missionary — winning Imperial favour through his knowledge of astronomy, cartography, and mathematics. By the 17th century, Jesuits like [Johann Adam Schall von Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Adam_Schall_von_Bell) and [Ferdinand Verbiest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Verbiest) had been appointed directors of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau — literally controlling the Chinese calendar.

This was the acme of Jesuit infiltration: from within the court, they could reshape the official cosmology of the world's most populous empire. But the [Chinese Rites controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Rites_controversy) — a hundred-year argument about whether Chinese Catholics could continue practising Confucian ancestor veneration — ultimately torpedoed the mission. In 1724, the [Yongzheng Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongzheng_Emperor) banned Christian proselytization and expelled most missionaries. As in Japan, a centralized Asian state had recognized the threat and shut it down.

### Southeast Asia and India: Partial Penetration

In India, the Jesuits pioneered the strategy of *inculturation* — adopting local dress, language, and customs to blend into the target culture. [Roberto de Nobili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_de_Nobili) (1577–1656) famously dressed as a Brahmin and studied Sanskrit to approach the Hindu scholarly class. In Southeast Asia, Jesuits penetrated Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Indonesian archipelago with varying degrees of success. The Philippines — already under Spanish colonial control — was the easiest target; Vietnam proved more resistant.

## Missionary Martyrdoms of the 17th Century

Across every theatre of the Asian campaign, missionaries were killed. The deaths followed the same pattern established in the Americas (see the [missionary-military pattern](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.05.00-1814-ce-the-jesuit-restoration-and-the-missionary-military-pattern.md)): peaceful missionaries arrived, built initial trust, pushed conversion, were killed by communities that recognized the existential threat, and their deaths were publicized in Europe as evidence of Asian "barbarism" requiring civilizing intervention.

Selected 17th century martyrdoms:

| Date | Location | Event |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1597 | Japan | [26 Martyrs of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26_Martyrs_of_Japan) crucified in Nagasaki |
| 1622 | Japan | [Great Martyrdom of Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Martyrdom) — 55 Christians executed |
| 1637–38 | Japan | Shimabara Rebellion — 37,000 killed |
| 1642–49 | North America | [North American Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Martyrs) — 8 Jesuits killed by Iroquois |
| 1649 | North America | [Jean de Brébeuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Br%C3%A9beuf) tortured and killed; reportedly had boiling water poured over him in mockery of baptism |
| 1660s | Vietnam | Multiple Jesuit missionaries executed under the [Nguyễn lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_lords) |

Each death added to the cumulative European narrative that non-Christian peoples were "savage" and required Western intervention — military, commercial, or both. The missionaries always took the punishment for the sins of the empire. The empire used their suffering as moral currency.

## Buddhism and the NC Framework

The NC observation that Buddhism and Christianity share biographical structures (the Buddha and Jesus have similar life stories, miraculous births, temptation narratives, teaching careers, and symbolic deaths) is not coincidence but design. Per the Marfull framework, both figures are expressions of the same underlying Imperial religious archetype — the Christ-Andronicus figure of the 12th century — adapted for different provincial audiences. When the Jesuits attempted to use Buddhist iconography and concepts to introduce Christianity to East Asia, they were unknowingly (or knowingly) reconnecting two branches of the same ancient root tradition.
