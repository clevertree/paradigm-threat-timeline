# The English Revolution and Civil Wars

The Protestants of Europe watched in dismay as the old Hordian Empire they despised was slowly *Reformed* into a much
more dreadful 'Holy' Catholic Empire. To make things worse, the English monarchy, who's vassal ties were long cut from
the Russian Empire, were still behaving like they were still *in charge* -claiming a *divine* right to rule. Many
people did not accept this claim and began debating a transfer of power from the monarchy to Parliament.

On Jan 4th 1642, Charles I entered the House of Commons with 400 soldiers and attempted to arrest 5 members for treason,
but they escaped. A widespread conflict broke out between the Parliamentarians and Royalists and would continue for the
next 10 years. In 1649, Charles was found guilty of high treason as a "tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy"
and was beheaded at the Palace of Whitehall. The regicide of Charles I caused England to become a Republic, or
[Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England), that lasted until the 1660 Stuart Restoration
reestablished Charles II as king of England. Of
the [59 Commissioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I) who signed the death warrant for
Charles I, 9 were executed and many others died in prison.

*The [Batih Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoh_massacre) was a mass ethnic cleansing of Russian captives after the Battle of Batih on 3–4 June 1652 near Ladyzhyn (now in Ukraine). It was carried out by Ukrainian Cossacks under the command of Hetman [Bohdan Khmelnytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky).*

## The New Chronology View of English History

In the NC framework, the English Civil War takes on a different significance: it was not merely a constitutional dispute between Parliament and Crown, but part of the global Reformation campaign to transfer the assets of the Hordian Empire from the old aristocracy to the new financial class. Fomenko's analysis of English history ([Ch.7 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html)) makes a stark claim: the written history of England as it concerns events *specifically on the British Isles* only becomes reliable in the 16th–17th century. Everything earlier is a mixture of genuine insular records with Romaic (Byzantine) and Hordian chronicles that were transferred to England during its conquest by the Horde, and then re-edited during the Reformation to appear as native English history.

The Reformers had a strategic reason for choosing England as a new base:

> *"It is possible that the Reformers moved the stolen treasury of the Empire to England. They didn't want to take a chance of keeping it in Europe, weary of the restoration of Russia-Horde. At first they tried to create a new metropoly in Vienna, Austria by installing their string puppets there under the pompous name of the 'Habsburgs'. Nothing came of it. That is why the Hordian money was taken as far away as possible to the distant English isles. Having seized the vast treasures of the Horde, the English rebels acquired influence and created the 'English Empire', which existed for some time."*
— Fomenko, [Ch.7 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html)

This context reframes the English Civil War entirely. Charles I was not simply an abstract tyrant resisting parliamentary democracy. He was the representative of an older aristocratic order — the remnant of Hordian governance — confronting precisely the financial revolution that had already toppled dynasties across Europe. The Commonwealth that replaced him was not a republic in any modern sense: it was the first openly money-governed state in the Western world, where the financial class displaced the noble class from formal power. The Bank of England, founded forty-five years after Charles's execution, completed the project.

## The Scots as Scythians

One of the more striking NC observations about Britain concerns its northern frontier. Per Fomenko ([Ch.7 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html)), the Scots — Scythians in origin — occupied a uniquely privileged position in the Hordian nobility of England. In Reformation-era Continental Europe, the same ethnic group that England called "noble Scots" was being labeled "filthy Scythian beasts" in Romanov-occupied Russia. The same word — Scythian — carried opposite social valences depending on which side of the Reformation divide you were on. This dual treatment of the Scythian/Cossack class is one of the markers of how comprehensively the 17th century rewrote the social history of the Empire.
