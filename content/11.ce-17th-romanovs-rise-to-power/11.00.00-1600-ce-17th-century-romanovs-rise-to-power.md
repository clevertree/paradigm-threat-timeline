# 17th Century-Romanovs Rise to power

The Oprichnina revolt dragged on into the 17th Century and was eventually put down by the Hordian dynasty-but
it was too late-the Protestants firmly had established themselves in the Horde's royal court backed by the Romanov
dynasty. Resistance of the remnants of Russia-Horde to their foreign rulers would continue to build up until the defeat
of [Pugachev's rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Rebellion) in 1775.

*The [King James Only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Only_movement) movement (also known as King James Onlyism) asserts the belief that the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is superior to all other translations of the Bible. Adherents believe that the KJV needs no further improvements because it is the greatest English translation of the Bible which was ever published, and they also believe that all other English translations published after the KJV are corrupt. Sometimes these beliefs are also based on the view that the King James translation itself was inspired by God.*

## The Time of Troubles (1598–1613)

Following the death of Feodor Ivanovich, the last undisputed Hordian czar, a succession crisis shook the Empire. Boris Godunov — better understood in the New Chronology as the legitimate heir, not an upstart politician — held the throne briefly. Then came the period the Romanov historians would later brand "The Time of Troubles": a succession of rulers including False Dmitry (the legitimate Czarevich, recognized as such by crowds and by his own mother) and Vasily Shuisky. Each transition weakened the Hordian structures and allowed pro-Western factions to deepen their grip on Moscow's court.

Fomenko notes that Boris Godunov was "the legitimate son of Fedor Ivanovich" and that the so-called "False Dmitry" was in fact the true Czarevich — falsely labeled an impostor by the Romanovs to retroactively legitimize their own illegal seizure. Dmitry's son was publicly hanged from the Spassky Gate solely to eliminate the last legitimate heir. The Romanov chronologists later buried this inconvenient reality beneath layers of competing false claimants. ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §5](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html))

## The Romanovs Seize the Throne

In 1613, the pro-Western Romanov-Zakharyin-Yurievs dynasty ascended to power — an event Fomenko characterizes plainly:

> *"In 1613 a sharp turning point took place — the pro-Western dynasty of the Romanovs-Zakharyin-Yurievs' ascent to the throne. The Romanovs banished the Cossack Horde from Moscovy."*

The election of Mikhail Romanov as czar was, by any constitutional standard of the time, unlawful — as the son of the actual former czar was still alive. The Romanovs knew this. That is why they immediately moved to destroy the documentary record: old tomb inscriptions in the Cathedral of the Archangel were bricked over, frescos whitewashed, and the Imperial necropolis reconstructed with relabeled graves. The Hordian army, which had been the enforcing arm of the old world-empire, was declared a foreign invader and expelled, its Cossack regiments pushed to the distant periphery. The regions they settled still bear their name: Kazakhstan = Cossack-Stan.

## The Empire Fractures

With the Romanovs in Moscow and pro-Reformation Western dynasties consolidating across Europe, the old unified Empire shattered into its component fragments. What had been provinces of a single administrative whole — each governed by a married-in vassal family — now declared themselves independent states and rewrote their own "ancient" histories. The resulting countries include Russia, Turkey (Ottoman Empire), Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Spain, Egypt, England, Middle East, Persia, China, Japan, India, and America. In each region, the old Hordian aristocracy either converted to their new role as independent monarchs or was liquidated.

New languages were deliberately constructed within a single generation to build cultural barriers between the fragments — French, German, Spanish, and English were all developed from Church-Slavonic roots specifically to prevent communication with the Imperial center. The [Index of Forbidden Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum) was introduced to suppress the old library system. Old books were burned.

## Resistance Continues

The Romanov seizure was not accepted without a fight. Throughout the 17th century, resistance flared in the form of Cossack-led uprisings — most notably the Razin Uprising (1670–71) centered in Astrakhan, the old Hordian stronghold on the Volga. The Romanovs framed this as a peasant revolt. In the NC framework, it was the Hordian military fighting to reclaim legitimate rule. The final showdown would come a century later with Pugachev's rebellion (1773–75), at which point the remaining territory of Moscow Tartary — still the largest country in the world according to the 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica — was carved up between the Romanovs and the newly-formed United States of America.
