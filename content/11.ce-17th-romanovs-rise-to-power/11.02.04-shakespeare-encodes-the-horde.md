# Shakespeare Encodes the Great Empire

![Shakespeare Encodes the Great Empire](/media/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/shakespeare.png)

William Shakespeare (1564–1616) lived in the late XVI – early XVII century, precisely the epoch when the Great Empire was fragmenting and its history was being rewritten. In the book [SAK], Fomenko and Nosovskiy demonstrate that Shakespeare's major plays are not fictional dramas set in vaguely "ancient" times — they are **encoded accounts of real events from the XII–XVI centuries**, set mainly in the metropoly of the Great Empire. The plays were written during or shortly after the events they describe, and their "ancient" settings are a product of the same chronological displacement that affected all European historiography.

## The Identifications

From [Chapter 7, §33](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_30.html) of *How It Was In Reality*:

> *"In the book [SAK] we show that such extraordinary Shakespearian plays as 'Hamlet', 'King Lear', 'Macbeth', 'Timon of Athens', 'Henry VIII', 'Titus Andronicus' (the time of which is erroneously dated today into the distant past and placed in the wrong geographical regions) in fact give an account of real and important events. Of the XII–XVI cc. unfolding mainly in the metropoly of the Great Empire."*

| Shakespeare play | NC identification | Century |
|---|---|---|
| **Hamlet** | Andronicus-Christ (Andrei Bogolyubsky) and John the Baptist | XII |
| **Macbeth** | The Biblical King Herod | XII |
| **Timon of Athens** | Judas Iscariot | XII |
| **Titus Andronicus** | Andronicus-Christ (another reflection) | XII |
| **King Lear** | Khan Ivan the Terrible | XVI |
| **Henry VIII** | Another reflection of Ivan the Terrible | XVI |
| **Catherine of Aragon** (in Henry VIII) | Czaritsa Sophia Palaiologina, wife of Ivan III=IV the Terrible | XVI |
| **Anne Boleyn** (in Henry VIII) | Elena Voloshanka = Biblical Esther | XVI |

The single character of Emperor Andronicus-Christ (Andrei Bogolyubsky) appears across multiple plays under different names: Prince Hamlet, MacDuff (in Macbeth), philosopher Apemantus (in Timon of Athens), and Titus Andronicus.

## The Method

Fomenko and Nosovskiy arrived at these identifications by cross-referencing Shakespeare's plots with other chronicles describing the same events — specifically the chronicles of **Geoffrey of Monmouth**, **Saxo Grammaticus**, and **Raphael Holinshed**. These chroniclers were Shakespeare's known sources, and they themselves were writing about the Great Empire under various displaced names and dates. When the NC chronological corrections are applied to all sources simultaneously, the convergence is striking: the same sequence of events — coup, betrayal, massacre, exile — appears in the Shakespearean drama, the medieval chronicle, and the biblical text, all describing the same historical episode.

As Fomenko notes:

> *"A dramatist and a poet add to the ancient chronicle some made-up details and emotionally decorate a scanty plot. The literary emotions take centre stage and conceal the true essence. It gets covered by a thick dust. A rather complex analysis is required to 'wipe the dust off'."*

## The XII Century Plays: Christ and His Epoch

The plays encoding XII century events revolve around the central figure of Andronicus-Christ:

- **Hamlet**: The prince whose father is murdered and who seeks justice against the usurpers — a dramatic retelling of the betrayal and crucifixion of Christ (= Andrei Bogolyubsky), with the Danish court standing in for the imperial court of Czar-Grad
- **Macbeth**: King Herod's massacre of the innocents, encoded as the Scottish succession crisis; MacDuff = Christ/Andronicus survives the slaughter
- **Timon of Athens**: The story of a generous benefactor betrayed by those he trusted — Judas Iscariot's betrayal inverted into a parable about ingratitude
- **Titus Andronicus**: The name itself preserves the identification — Titus Andronicus = Emperor Andronicus

## The XVI Century Plays: Ivan the Terrible and the Oprichnina

The plays encoding XVI century events describe the crisis of the [Oprichnina](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.00-1565-ce-romanov-dynasty-stages-the-oprichnina-coup.md) — the Zakharyin-Romanov coup that destroyed the Horde dynasty:

- **King Lear**: The aging king who divides his realm among his children and is destroyed by the ungrateful ones — Ivan the Terrible's division of the Empire and the subsequent civil war. Lear's madness = Ivan's manipulation by the Oprichniki. The loyal daughter Cordelia = the Horde-loyalist faction that tried to preserve the Empire.
- **Henry VIII**: The English king's marital dramas encode the Russian court's succession crisis. Catherine of Aragon = Sophia Palaiologina (the legitimate Horde-dynasty wife); Anne Boleyn = Elena Voloshanka = [Biblical Esther](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.01-redacted-into-the-books-of-esther-judith.md) (the "foreign" woman who infiltrates the court and precipitates the massacre/Purim).

Shakespeare was writing about events that were, at most, one or two generations in the past — not ancient history. The displacement of his settings to "ancient Denmark," "ancient Scotland," "ancient Rome," and "ancient Britain" is the same chronological obfuscation applied to all European historiography in the XVII–XVIII centuries.

## One or More Authors?

The NC analysis does not require resolving the "Shakespeare authorship question" — whether the plays were written by William Shakespeare of Stratford, Francis Bacon, the Earl of Oxford, or a committee. What matters is that the **source material** — the chronicles of Geoffrey of Monmouth, Saxo Grammaticus, and Holinshed — encoded Great Empire history, and the playwright(s) dramatized this material. The encoded history is in the *sources*, not merely in the dramatic adaptation.

However, the NC framework does suggest that the playwright(s) may have had access to suppressed Hordian chronicles that were being systematically destroyed in the early XVII century. The *specificity* of the parallels — not just broad structural matches but detailed sequence-level correspondence — implies sources beyond what survived into the modern historical record.
