# London 1664-1694: The Financial Coup

Between 1664 and 1694, London experienced the most concentrated sequence of destabilization in its history — a thirty-year arc that transformed the last independent financial center in Europe into the headquarters of a centralized banking system that would eventually govern the world.

This was not a series of unfortunate coincidences. It was a coordinated campaign:

1. **1664–65**: A [great comet](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.02-1664-ce-the-great-comet-of-1664-1665.md) appeared in the sky for over 80 days, interpreted as divine judgment
2. **1664–66**: The [Great Plague](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.03-1664-ce-the-great-plague-of-1664-1666.md) killed 15% of London's population, devastating the guild and goldsmith communities
3. **Sept 2–6, 1666**: The [Great Fire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.04-1666-ce-london-burns-to-the-ground.md) destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, the Guildhall, St. Paul's Cathedral, and the Royal Exchange — the physical infrastructure of the old financial order
4. **1666**: The [Cestui Que Vie Act](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.04-1666-ce-london-burns-to-the-ground.md) was passed — a legal mechanism to declare absent persons dead and their estates managed by others
5. **1667**: The [Dutch burned the English fleet](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.06-1667-ce-the-dutch-burn-the-english-fleet.md) — military humiliation leading to the fall of Clarendon
6. **1668–74**: Charles II ruled through [the Cabal](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.07-1668-ce-the-cabal-englands-shadow-cabinet.md) — five non-Anglican ministers, two of them secret Catholics, in a Protestant nation
7. **1672**: The [Stop of the Exchequer](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.08-1672-ce-deep-state-targets-independent-banks.md) — Charles suspended all payments, ruining the independent goldsmiths and destroying 10,000 families
8. **1694**: The [Bank of England](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.09-1694-ce-deep-state-solidifies-central-banking.md) was founded on a Mithras temple — centralizing all currency under a joint-stock corporation answerable to shareholders, not citizens

Britannica confirms the sequence was recognized even at the time:

> *"The Great Plague of London (1664–66) and the Great Fire of London (1666) were interpreted as divine judgments against a sinful nation. These catastrophes were compounded when the Dutch burned a large portion of the English fleet in 1667, which led to the dismissal and exile of Clarendon. The crown's debts led to the Stop of the Exchequer (1672), by which Charles suspended payment of his bills."* — [Britannica, "The Later Stuarts"](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/The-later-Stuarts)

## The Goldsmiths: The Real Target

The London [goldsmiths](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.05-the-goldsmiths-and-the-death-of-independent-valuation.md) were not merely wealthy merchants. They were the last independent financial power in Europe — inheritors of the old Imperial treasury infrastructure that Fomenko identifies as having been moved to England by the Reformers ([Ch.7 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html)). Their ability to independently appraise gold and determine the relative value of all goods against it made them a direct threat to the royal currency. As long as independent valuation existed, no centralized monetary authority could achieve total control.

The gold ended up in London through Imperial trade flows and the deliberate transfer of the Horde's treasury. The goldsmiths managed it independently as a professional guild. But the Deep State needed to seize control from them to install the new centralized system. The 1664–1694 sequence was the mechanism of that seizure.

## The Apocalyptic Context

The entire sequence was framed by an [apocalyptic prophecy](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.01-1666-ce-the-apocalypse-prophecy-of-1666.md): the year 1666 was read as "the 666th year of our Lord" — the number of the beast from Revelation. London's leadership was told of an impending divine judgment, using the same technique of prophetic letters that had been employed in 1492 but now by different and yet undisclosed means. When each catastrophe arrived — comet, plague, fire — it confirmed the prophecy for those inclined to believe, and silenced the political will of those who might have resisted.
