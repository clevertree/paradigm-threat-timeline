# Deep State breaks up the Hordian Empire

Placing the Romanov Dynasty at the highest level of authority in the Hordian Empire gave the Pyramidal Empire a unique
opportunity to rewrite Russian history. The motive behind this redaction was to *fracture* the empire into controllable
states and then maximize their clandestine influence (*deep*) over each state. This is how the world-wide Hordian
Empire was erased-redacted from all published literature into *independent states history* under different names -
Russia, Turkey / Atamania as the Ottoman Empire, Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Spain,
Egypt, England, Middle East, Persia, China, Japan, India, America and many European, Asian and African countries.
Each region already had a vassal aristocratic family originally married into the Hordian Empire in its prime. As these
ties were cut, these families would become the Kings and Queens of *their own* states.

Although the Rus-Horde Empire was broken up, the Pyramidal Empire and their Western vassal states still feared the eventual
reemergence of the old empire and began targeting its history and culture. They launched
a [modernization campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_reform_of_Peter_the_Great)
through their Romanov
puppet [Czar Peter I "The Great"](https://www.history.com/news/peter-the-great-tortured-killed-own-son) to
incorporate Russia into *'modern'* Europe. During his reign he reformed the calendar
and [alphabet](https://www.prlib.ru/en/history/619018), and moved the Russian Headquarters to St Petersburg. With these
reforms, the Pyramidal Empire's objective was to put pressure on the Orthodox Church's autonomy, significantly reducing its
religious influence. This campaign
of [Anti-Russian Sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Russian_sentiment#18th_and_19th_centuries) would continue
for the next 3 centuries and
is [still active today](https://www.rt.com/russia/569147-zakharova-odessa-monuments-history/).
Fomenko [describes the redaction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html#the703):

> The Romanovs re-wrote the history of Russia. In particular, the Russian-Horde army was declared to be an evil foreign
> power, which conquered not just Western Europe – now it is only mentioned in passing – but allegedly Russia itself.

## "To Turn Cattle into People"

The Romanov modernization campaign was not benign Westernization. Fomenko records a private statement by Peter I to the Danish ambassador Jens Juel in 1710 that captures the Romanov attitude toward the old Hordian subjects of Russia:

> *"Peter I's own expression in the presence of the Danish ambassador Jens Juel in 1710: 'TO TURN CATTLE INTO PEOPLE.'"*
— Fomenko, [Ch.7 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html)

This contemptuous framing — treating the native Russian-Hordian population as subhuman livestock requiring civilizing — was not an accident of translation. It reflected the Romanov court's genuine self-understanding as a Western-aligned foreign occupying power managing a conquered population. Peter's reforms (the new calendar, the reformed alphabet, the mandatory European dress code, the prohibition of women's traditional tower-chambers, the mandatory beard-shaving, the transfer of the capital to Petersburg) were all designed to sever the cultural and institutional ties between the Russian population and their Hordian heritage.

Fomenko notes the suspicion that the Peter who returned from his famous Western journey (1697–1698) was not the same person who had left. Whether or not this is literally true, it encapsulates the radical discontinuity of Russian cultural identity that the Romanov dynasty introduced. ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html))

## The Double-Headed Eagle as Crescent-and-Star

The double-headed eagle — one of the most recognizable symbols of the Hordian Empire — is itself an encoded account of the Empire's dual structure. Per Fomenko's analysis ([Ch.7 §7](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html)), the two-headed eagle is a transformation of the crescent moon with a star cross: one head represents the Ottoman Turkish branch (crescent), the other the Russian Hordian branch (cross/star). When the Empire fragmented and its symbol was split into the Orthodox cross, the Islamic crescent-and-star, and the Jewish six-pointed star, the double-headed eagle survived as the residual emblem of states (Russia, Austria, Albania) that still remembered their Imperial inheritance.

Albrecht Dürer's *Arch of Maximilian I* (from the early 16th century, though Fomenko argues it was created in the 17th century) depicts the two-headed eagle in precisely the crescent-and-star configuration that confirms this reading.

## St. Petersburg: An Escape Hatch

The relocation of Russia's capital from Moscow to the newly-built St. Petersburg in 1703 had a strategic logic that the Romanov historians never adequately explained. Peter's official rationale — a "window to Europe" for trade — does not explain why the entire governmental center of the largest country in the world needed to be moved to a swamp on the Gulf of Finland.

Fomenko's explanation is more direct: Moscow was too close to the border of Moscow Tartary. If the Siberian-American Horde ever launched a sufficiently powerful counter-attack (which it nearly did under Pugachev seventy years later), the Romanovs from Moscow would have been trapped. From St. Petersburg, they were days away from ships that would carry them to Western Europe — to their relatives and allies in the German courts. The capital move was insurance for an occupying foreign dynasty that never felt entirely secure on stolen ground. ([Chronologia, Ch.8 §1](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html))
