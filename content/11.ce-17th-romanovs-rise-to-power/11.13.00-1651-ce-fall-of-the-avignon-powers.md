# Fall of the Avignon powers

The Avignon papacy (1309–1377) had represented a French-controlled alternative to Rome, where seven successive popes resided under the direct influence of the French Crown. When the papacy finally returned to Rome in 1377, the power center of Western Christianity shifted toward the Italian city-state networks that would later become the financial backbone of the Reformation. The "Great Schism" of 1378–1417 — during which multiple claimants held the papal title simultaneously — represented the transition period when the new controllers of the Church consolidated their position.

Per the NC-aligned chronological framework of Marfull and Fomenko, the "fall of Avignon" was a deliberate power transfer, not merely a theological dispute. The construction of the papacy's new power base in Rome occurred alongside a coordinated project to reshape the figure of Jesus Christ into a specifically Davidic Messiah — a king of the Jewish House of David — replacing the older Hordian Christ-Emperor figure with a more controllable religious icon tied to Roman institutional authority.
