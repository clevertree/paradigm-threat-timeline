# The Romanov Seizure and Fracturing of the Empire (1611-1627)

The first three decades of the 17th century witnessed the most consequential political transformation in human history: the destruction of the world's only superpower and its replacement with a collection of puppet states, each governed by a vassal family that had once owed fealty to a single Imperial throne. The Romanov seizure of Moscow in 1613, the publication of the King James Bible in 1611, and the Jesuit chronologist Petavius's rewriting of world history in 1627 were not independent events — they were three coordinated strikes against the old order.

The [Oprichnina revolt](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.06.00-1565-ce-romanov-dynasty-stages-the-oprichnina-coup.md) of the previous century had planted pro-Western agents deep within the Hordian court. By the early 1600s, these agents were ready to move. The "Time of Troubles" (1598–1613) — with its rapid succession of rulers, each weaker than the last — was not a spontaneous crisis but a carefully managed destabilization. When the dust settled, the Romanov-Zakharyin-Yurievs sat on the throne, and the legitimate heirs were dead.

What followed was a systematic campaign of erasure: the old Imperial records were destroyed, the Hordian army was expelled to the periphery, new languages were invented to create cultural barriers between the fragments of the old Empire, and a fake chronology was mass-distributed to make the new order appear ancient and inevitable. Every newly independent kingdom — France, England, Germany, Spain, the Ottomans — adopted the same strategy: invent an "ancient" national history, burn the Imperial library, and declare independence from a center that no longer existed.
