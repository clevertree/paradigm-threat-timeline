# The almogavars conquer Athens and Neopatria

The Almogavars were a class of Catalan and Aragonese foot soldiers — the most feared light infantry of the late medieval Mediterranean — recruited primarily from mountain communities along the Aragonese-Muslim frontier. Their conquest of Athens and the Duchy of Neopatria (in the Scaligerian chronology, dated 1312–1331) established the Catalan Company as the dominant power in the Greek archipelago for nearly a century.

In the NC framework, the Almogavars represent the mercenary military wing of the Reformationist project in the Eastern Mediterranean. Their devastation of Byzantine Greece weakened the eastern half of the old Empire, making it vulnerable to the final Ottoman/Hordian takeover that the chronologists later dated to 1453. The settlement of western Jews in Thessaloniki, noted in the Marfull framework, locates the Imperial treasury officials in the newly-conquered territories — establishing the financial infrastructure the new rulers needed.

The patron saint narrative — the warrior spirit of Saint George — overlays the Almogavar campaigns with a crusading religious justification that was standard for all Reformationist military operations against old Imperial territories. In the NC reconstruction, Saint George's dragon-slaying iconography is a transformation of the Hordian imperial symbol: the dragon = the old Hordian serpent banner of the Empire.
