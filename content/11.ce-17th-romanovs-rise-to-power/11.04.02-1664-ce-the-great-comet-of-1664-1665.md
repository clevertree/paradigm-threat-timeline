# The Great Comet of 1664 / 1665

Either by coincidence (or more likely by some design of Deep State engineers), a series of phenomenal comets approached
Earth prior to the apocalyptic date in shorter intervals and longer progressions. The largest and longest
lasting [comet](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxxvii/)
of the series was seen between 1664(C / 1664 W1) and 1665(C / 1665 F1) which lasted over 80 days.

## Comets in the NC Framework

Per the New Chronology, the historical interpretation of comets as divine omens is not merely superstition — it reflects genuine observational reality that the Scaligerian chronological system systematically misdated. Fomenko's astronomical analysis shows that the star catalogue in the famous Almagest (traditionally attributed to Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD) was actually finalized in the 17th century, with its "ancient" observations calculated backward using the incomplete astronomical theory of that era. ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §21](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html))

The Great Comet of 1664–65 preceded the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London in 1666 — a sequence of catastrophes that the English population experienced as a cosmic series, consistent with the Deep State campaign to destabilize the old order and clear the ground for the new financial architecture. Whether the timing was deliberate or coincidental, the effect was identical: major disruption of existing property, authority, and social structures across England in a three-year period, culminating in the founding of the Bank of England three decades later.
