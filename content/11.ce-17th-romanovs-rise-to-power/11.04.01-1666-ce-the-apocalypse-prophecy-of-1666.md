# The Apocalypse Prophecy of 1666

> **Author's Theory**: The following interpretation is my own reconstruction. No online sources correlating these events in this specific sequence have been found. If you encounter supporting or contradicting evidence, please contribute to the [investigation](/investigations/).

## The Year of Our Lord 666

The year 1666 was a **weapon**. Written as <code>ι</code>666, it read as "in the 666th year of the Lord," directly invoking the [Number of the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_beast) from Revelation. For a population steeped in apocalyptic Christianity, this date carried existential weight.

> During the first half of the seventeenth century some extravagant notions of the near approach of the Messianic time, and more especially of the redemption of the Jews and their return to Jerusalem, were set forth by Christian writers and entertained by Jews and Christians alike. The so-called apocalyptic year was assigned by Christian authors to the year 1666.

I believe London's leadership was **told** of an impending apocalypse for September 1666 — the same technique used in 1492 with [prophetic letters](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.06.00-1492-ce-the-apocalypse-crusade.md), but by undisclosed means.

## The Sabbatean Messianic Mania of 1665–1666

London was not alone. Across the Jewish diaspora — from Smyrna to Amsterdam, Aleppo to Hamburg — tens of thousands simultaneously believed 1666 would bring the end of history. A Smyrna-born kabbalist, **Sabbatai Zevi**, was declared the agent of redemption by **Nathan of Gaza** in 1665, with the climax expected in 1666. The declaration spread faster than any news network should have carried it. Jewish communities across three continents entered mass mania — abandoning livelihoods, selling property, preparing for return to the Holy Land.

Note the key phrase from the JewishEncyclopedia: **"Jews and Christians alike."** This was a multi-faith, multi-continent expectation. The question is: **who told them all simultaneously, and by what mechanism?**

### The Dual Collapse: September 1666

Both prophecies collapsed in September 1666. London [burned to the ground](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.04-1666-ce-london-burns-to-the-ground.md) (13,200 houses, 87 churches, St. Paul's Cathedral). Simultaneously, the Ottoman Sultan arrested Sabbatai Zevi and forced his conversion to Islam. Two separate religious populations spanning Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East had been convinced — and both were shattered in the same month. The conventional explanation is coincidence.

A significant number of Zevi's followers reinterpreted the failure as a necessary mystical step, allowing the Sabbatean sect to persist for over a century, eventually spawning the Dönmeh crypto-Jewish community and influencing Frankism.

## The Sequence of Belief and Doubt (London)

The psychological manipulation unfolded in stages:

1. **The Prophecy (pre-1664)**: London's royalty and clergy were informed that divine judgment would fall in the year 666. The seed was planted.
2. **The Comet (1664–1665)**: The [Great Comet](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.02-1664-ce-the-great-comet-of-1664-1665.md) appeared for over 80 days. Believers became certain; skeptics grew uneasy. Morton called it "sent immediately by God to awake the secure world."
3. **The Comet Departs (early 1665)**: Doubts returned. Perhaps just a natural phenomenon.
4. **The Plague (1665–1666)**: The [Great Plague](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.03-1664-ce-the-great-plague-of-1664-1666.md) killed 100,000 (15% of London). Opinion split — divine punishment or medieval filth?
5. **The Fire (September 1666)**: London burned. Many accused the government. But it was too late — political will to resist had died in the flames.
6. **The Aftermath**: The royal class became convinced they had witnessed genuine divine judgment. This psychological victory — the belief that God had punished the wicked — set the tone for the British Empire's next three centuries: anything done in God's name was justified.

## Lubieniecki Confirms the Connection

The Polish theologian and astronomer Stanisław Lubieniecki (1623–1675) observed both comets from Hamburg and published *Theatrum cometicum* (1668), stating the Great Fire of London was **a punishment from God announced by the 1664 comet**.

*Lubieniecki's Theatrum cometicum (1668) connected the 1664 comet to the Great Fire as divine judgment. [Source](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxxvii/)*
