# The Apocalypse Prophecy of 1666

> **Author's Theory**: The following interpretation is my own reconstruction of events. No online sources correlating these events in this specific sequence have been found. If you encounter supporting or contradicting evidence, please contribute to the [investigation](/investigations/).

## The Year of Our Lord 666

The year 1666 was not merely a date — it was a **weapon**. Written in the convention of the time as <code>ι</code>666, it read as "in the 666th year of the Lord," directly invoking the [Number of the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_beast) from the Book of Revelation. For a population steeped in apocalyptic Christianity — where the Bible was taken as literal prophecy — this date carried existential weight.

> During the first half of the seventeenth century some extravagant notions of the near approach of the Messianic time, and more especially of the redemption of the Jews and their return to Jerusalem, were set forth by Christian writers and entertained by Jews and Christians alike. The so-called apocalyptic year was assigned by Christian authors to the year 1666.

## The Same Technique, Different Means

I believe London's leadership was **told** of an impending apocalypse event scheduled for September 1666. This was exactly the same technique used in 1492 — when [prophetic letters](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.06.00-1492-ce-the-apocalypse-crusade.md) were circulated to terrify populations into compliance — but done by a very different and yet undisclosed means. The mechanism of delivery remains unknown, but the effect is clear: the royal class believed it.

## Not Just London: The Sabbatean Messianic Mania of 1665–1666

London was not the only place where people expected the world to change in 1666. Across the Jewish diaspora — from Smyrna to Amsterdam, from Aleppo to Hamburg, from Morocco to Poland — tens of thousands of Jews simultaneously believed that 1666 would bring the **end of history** and the restoration of Israel. The vehicle was a Smyrna-born kabbalist named **Sabbatai Zevi** (Shabbetai Zvi).

In 1665, a young student of Lurianic Kabbalah named **Nathan of Gaza** declared that Sabbatai Zevi was the long-awaited agent of redemption, with the climax expected in **1666**. The declaration spread with astonishing speed — faster than any news network of the era should have been able to carry it. Within months, Jewish communities across **three continents** were in a state of mass mania. Tens of thousands abandoned their livelihoods, sold their property, and prepared for an imminent return to the Holy Land. Businesses closed. Whole communities entered a state of ecstatic anticipation.

> *"During the first half of the seventeenth century some extravagant notions of the near approach of the Messianic time, and more especially of the redemption of the Jews and their return to Jerusalem, were set forth by Christian writers and entertained by Jews and Christians alike."*
<cite>[JewishEncyclopedia.com — Shabbethai Ẓebi](https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13480-shabbethai-zebi-b-mordecai)</cite>

Note the key phrase: **"Jews and Christians alike."** This was not a phenomenon confined to one religion or one city. It was a **multi-faith, multi-continent expectation** that something world-changing would happen in 1666. The question is not whether people believed it — they demonstrably did. The question is: **who told them all at the same time, and by what mechanism?**

### The Collapse: September 1666

The Sabbatean movement reached its crisis point in **September 1666** — the same month London burned. The Ottoman Sultan arrested Sabbatai Zevi and gave him a choice: **death or conversion to Islam**. Zevi chose conversion, taking the name Aziz Mehmed Effendi.

For many followers, this was the end — a devastating disillusionment. But for a significant number, it was not. His remaining followers reinterpreted the failure, arguing that the conversion was a **necessary mystical step** in the redemption process — that the delays and tribulations were the "birth pangs" of the Messiah. This rationalization allowed the Sabbatean sect to persist for **over a century**, eventually spawning the Dönmeh crypto-Jewish community within the Ottoman Empire and influencing later movements including Frankism.

### The Pattern

Consider the timeline:
- **Christian Europe**: Apocalyptic prophecy assigns divine judgment to the year 1666, the "year of the Beast"
- **Jewish diaspora**: Messianic prophecy assigns the restoration of Israel to the year 1666
- **London**: Burns to the ground in **September 1666**
- **Ottoman Empire**: Sabbatai Zevi is arrested and forced to convert in **September 1666**

Two entirely separate religious populations, spanning Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, were simultaneously convinced that 1666 would bring a world-altering event. Both prophecies **collapsed in September of that year** — one in fire, one in apostasy. The conventional explanation is coincidence. The alternative is that someone, or some group, was **seeding apocalyptic expectations across multiple populations simultaneously**, using different religious frameworks to deliver the same message: *the world changes in 1666*.

## The Sequence of Belief and Doubt (London)

The psychological manipulation unfolded in stages:

### Stage 1: The Prophecy (pre-1664)
London's royalty and clergy were informed — through channels we cannot yet identify — that divine judgment would fall on the city in the year 666. Many believed. Many did not. But the seed was planted.

### Stage 2: The Comet (1664-1665)
When the [Great Comet](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.02-1664-ce-the-great-comet-of-1664-1665.md) appeared in the sky and remained visible for over 80 days, the believers became **certain**. Here was the sign from heaven — the herald of the approaching judgment. The skeptics grew uneasy.

> [Nathanial] Morton said to them that it was "no fiery meteor caused by exhalation, but it appeared to be sent immediately by God to awake the secure world."
<cite>[Historic Storms of New England, Sidney Perley, 1891](http://www.colonialsense.com/Society-Lifestyle/Signs_of_the_Times/New_England_Weather/The_Comet_of_1664.php)</cite>

### Stage 3: The Comet Departs (early 1665)
When the comet faded from the sky, many had doubts again. Perhaps it was just a natural phenomenon. Perhaps the prophecy was false. The tension between belief and skepticism divided the population.

### Stage 4: The Plague (1665-1666)
When the [Great Plague](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.03-1664-ce-the-great-plague-of-1664-1666.md) struck, killing 100,000 people — 15% of London's population — opinion split again. Was this divine punishment, or was it the filth and overcrowding of a medieval city? The religious saw the hand of God. The practical saw rats and sewage. Neither side could convince the other.

### Stage 5: The Fire (September 2-6, 1666)
When London [burned to the ground](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.04-1666-ce-london-burns-to-the-ground.md) — 13,200 houses, 87 churches, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Guildhall, the Royal Exchange — many accused the government of starting it. They were right to be suspicious. But it was **too late**. The political will to resist had died in the fire.

The royal class was now more sure than ever that the prophecy had come true. **God had revealed himself by smiting the wicked.** The fire was not a disaster to be investigated — it was a **confirmation** of divine authority.

### Stage 6: The Aftermath
This psychological victory — the conviction among the ruling class that they had witnessed genuine divine judgment — set the tone for everything that followed. The cynical, detached, religiously sanctioned exploitation that would characterize the **British Empire** for the next three centuries was rooted in this moment. If God had burned London to punish the wicked, then *anything* done in God's name was justified. The goldsmiths had been wicked. The independent City had been wicked. Only obedience to the divinely sanctioned Crown — and its banking apparatus — could prevent future judgment.

## The Polish theologian Lubieniecki confirms the connection

The Polish theologian, historian and astronomer, Stanisław Lubieniecki (1623–1675) observed both comets from Hamburg and published his *Theatrum cometicum* in 1668, in which he stated his opinion that the Great Fire of London was **a punishment from God announced by the 1664 comet**.

*Lubieniecki's Theatrum cometicum (1668) connected the 1664 comet directly to the Great Fire of London as divine judgment. [Source](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxxvii/)*
