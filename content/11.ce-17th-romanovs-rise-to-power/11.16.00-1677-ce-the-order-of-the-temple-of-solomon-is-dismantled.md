# The Order of the Temple of Solomon is dismantled

The date equation presented in the Marfull/Fomenko framework — **1307 = 1492 = 1677** — is one of the most striking chronological compressions in the New Chronology reconstruction of medieval history. It asserts that the suppression of the Knights Templar conventionally dated to 1307 (under Philip IV of France), the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 (under Ferdinand and Isabella), and a 17th century event are in fact the same episode repeated in the historical record at three different apparent dates due to systematic chronological inflation.

Per the Marfull framework, the real event underlying all three dates is the dismantling of the old Imperial military-financial order: the Templar/Hospitaller network that had administered the financial and military infrastructure of the Hordian Empire across the Mediterranean. When this order was dismantled, the colonial enterprise shifted from a unified Imperial model to a competitive Italian/French/Spanish state model — the colonial competition that produced the Age of Exploration.

The creation of the Order of Saint John (1312 = 1497 = 1682 in the same compression) to replace the Templars represents the reformatting of this military-financial infrastructure under new management — specifically under the Roman papacy rather than the Imperial Khan. The figure of Prester John, the legendary Christian king-priest sought by European crusaders, is reinterpreted here as the Baptist figure camouflaging the real identity of the Hordian Czar/Khan of the old Empire.
