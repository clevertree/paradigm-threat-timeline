# The Marfull Framework: Mediterranean Realignment

The Marfull chronological framework — developed by researchers building on Fomenko's New Chronology — provides a parallel reconstruction of 17th century events focused on the **Mediterranean theatre**: the Catalan-Aragonese military campaigns, the inter-religious disputes between Judaism and Christianity, the dismantling of the Templar military-financial order, and the consolidation of Roman papal authority over the competing Avignon papacy.

The key insight of the Marfull framework is the **chronological compression**: events conventionally dated to the 13th–15th centuries (the Cathar Crusades, the Templar suppression, the Tortosa Dispute) are identified as **17th century events** that were backdated by the Scaligerian chronological system. The equation **1307 = 1492 = 1677** — asserting that the Templar suppression, the Spanish expulsion of Jews, and a 17th century restructuring are the same event recorded at three different apparent dates — is one of the most striking claims in the New Chronology reconstruction.

These Mediterranean events were not isolated from the Northern European drama of the Romanov seizure and the English financial coup. They represent the **southern front** of the same global restructuring: the transfer of military, financial, and religious authority from the old Imperial order to the new system of competing nation-states governed by an invisible financial network.

Per the [Marfull chronological framework](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html), the inter-religious disputes between Judaism and Christianity spanning 1633–1725 CE were the theological dimension of a political transformation — the creation of separate, controllable religious denominations out of what had been a unified Imperial religious tradition.
