# Resistance and Religious Wars (1618-1660)

The fracturing of the Hordian Empire did not go unopposed. From the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) that devastated Central Europe to the English Civil War (1642–1651) that beheaded a king, the 17th century was defined by resistance — both from remnants of the old Hordian order and from populations who recognized the new rulers as illegitimate.

The Deep State's strategy was not to crush resistance directly but to redirect it: turn the old Empire's successor states against each other, exploit religious divisions that the Reformation had created, and ensure that no coalition could form large enough to restore the old order. The Thirty Years' War killed 8 million people and reduced some German territories by half — not as collateral damage, but as deliberate depopulation of regions where Hordian memory was strongest. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) that ended it was not a peace treaty but a **carve-up agreement**, making it institutionally illegal for any power to attempt to reunify Europe.

In England, the Civil War transferred power from the aristocratic class to the financial class — the first time in European history that money formally displaced ancestry as the basis of political authority. In Ukraine, the Cossack–Polish War continued the ethnic cleansing of populations loyal to the old Empire. And across the Mediterranean, Russia and Turkey — the two largest fragments of the Horde — were deliberately turned against each other through religious provocations that would sustain 300 years of intermittent warfare.
