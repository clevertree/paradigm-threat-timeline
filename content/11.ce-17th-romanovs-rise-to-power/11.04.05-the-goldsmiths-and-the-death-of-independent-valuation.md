# The Goldsmiths and the Death of Independent Valuation

> **Author's Theory**: The following interpretation is my own reconstruction. The argument that the destruction of the goldsmith class represented the death of independent economic valuation — and that this was the origin of modern poverty — is not found in any single online source. If you encounter supporting or contradicting evidence, please contribute to the [investigation](/investigations/).

## More Than Money-Lenders

The popular image of the London goldsmith — Dickens's Scrooge counting coins in a dark office — fundamentally misrepresents who these people were and why they had to be destroyed. The goldsmiths were not merely wealthy merchants wielding undue financial influence. They were a **threat to the royal currency itself**.

The key to the threat was the goldsmiths' ability to **appraise gold — and everything else against its value**. A goldsmith could examine a bar of metal and tell you its exact purity. He could examine a ship's cargo and tell you its worth relative to gold. He could examine a piece of land, a building, a trade route, and assign it a value that was *objective* — rooted in the physical reality of measurable precious metal content.

As long as the goldsmiths could do this, they could decide some things were **more or less valuable** than the Crown declared them to be. This was not merely financial competition — it was an alternative reality. The Crown said a shilling was worth what the Crown said it was worth. The goldsmith could melt the shilling down and tell you what it was *actually* worth. Two competing systems of value cannot coexist indefinitely. One must destroy the other.

## The Imperial Inheritance

Fomenko's New Chronology provides the historical context for why London's goldsmiths had this power in the first place. Per [Ch.7 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html):

> *"It is possible that the Reformers moved the stolen treasury of the Empire to England. They didn't want to take a chance of keeping it in Europe, weary of the restoration of Russia-Horde... Having seized the vast treasures of the Horde, the English rebels acquired influence and created the 'English Empire', which existed for some time."*

The gold that London's smiths appraised and traded was not merely local wealth — it was the residue of the Hordian Imperial treasury, the accumulated wealth of a world empire. The goldsmiths were the **inheritors** of the old Imperial financial infrastructure, managing it independently as a professional guild. They were not Deep State agents — they were custodians of the old system who had to be crushed to install the new centralized system.

Fomenko's analysis of the Imperial financial caste ([Ch.9 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/09.html)) describes the transition:

> *"The driving force behind all such revolutions was money. As a result they openly declared the domination of money over noble rank, over ancestry. This was the motto of the French revolution and of the English revolution."*

## The System That Replaced Them

The [Bank of England](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.09-1694-ce-deep-state-solidifies-central-banking.md), founded in 1694 on the site of a [Mithras](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mithraism) temple — the Roman god of contracts — was not merely a new bank. It was the **replacement of independent valuation with institutional decree**. Where the goldsmith could tell you what things were actually worth, the Bank of England told you what things were *declared* to be worth. The difference is the difference between measurement and proclamation — between science and religion.

The Bank was tied to religion by design. It was established by royal charter — the same divine authority that had been "confirmed" by the [apocalyptic events of 1664-1666](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.01-1666-ce-the-apocalypse-prophecy-of-1666.md). Its authority derived not from the measurable reality of gold weight but from the divinely sanctioned power of the Crown. Other joint-stock banks were explicitly prohibited from issuing banknotes — a monopoly that made independent valuation not just impractical but illegal.

## The Birth of Poverty

This switch — from independent valuation to centralized decree — was the **start of real-world poverty**, the likes of which were never seen or imagined before on Earth.

Before the Bank of England, a person's wealth could be independently verified. Gold is gold. Its weight and purity are measurable facts. A goldsmith's appraisal was accountable to physical reality. Under this system, poverty existed but it was *local* and *addressable* — you were poor because you lacked resources, and the path to less poverty was acquiring more of those real resources.

After the Bank of England, wealth became a *declaration* — a number on a ledger maintained by an institution that answered to shareholders, not citizens. Poverty was no longer the absence of resources but the absence of *access to the ledger*. You could be standing on gold-rich land, growing food, producing goods of measurable value, and still be declared "poor" because the central bank's ledger said so. This is the poverty we know today — not the poverty of scarcity but the **poverty of exclusion** from an arbitrary accounting system.

The goldsmiths' destruction was the destruction of economic accountability. What replaced it was a system where value was whatever the Bank said it was — and the Bank answered to private shareholders whose identities were, and remain, obscure.

## The Sequence of Destruction

1. **1660**: Charles II restored to the throne — immediately subject to financial pressures
2. **1660**: Parliament caps interest at 6% ("An Act for restraining the taking of Excessive Usury")
3. **1662**: [Hearth taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth_tax#England) imposed — requiring biannual audits of every household (surveillance infrastructure)
4. **1664–66**: Comet, Plague, Fire — physical destruction of the goldsmith community and its institutional base
5. **1667–72**: Charles bypasses Parliament, borrows directly from goldsmiths at discounts that exceed the 6% cap
6. **1672**: [Great Stop of the Exchequer](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.04.08-1672-ce-deep-state-targets-independent-banks.md) — Charles suspends all payments, destroying the goldsmiths
7. **1694**: Bank of England founded — monopoly on banknotes, independent valuation made illegal
