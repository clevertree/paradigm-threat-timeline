# Cathars are annihilated in a *reversed* "Holy" Crusade & Inquisition

In the early 17th century, the Pyramidal Empire would begin brutally eradicating any ideological threats to their Reformation.
The eventual [annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Annihilation) of the Cathars would signify the
end of original *Gnostic* Christianity in Western Europe, and its replacement with the modern Abrahamic/Monotheistic
religion known as **Catholicism**. The theological mechanism by which indigenous solar religion — in which
Christ was an allegory for the Sun's annual zodiacal journey — was overwritten into an invisible-God
monotheism controlled by Rome is analysed in
[Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md). Many Cathars were publicly burned at the stake. This event was remembered in the words
*cauterize*, *catharize*, and *catharsis* which all mean **purging by fire**, and yet the word *Catholic / katholikos*
still translates to *Holy Katherine*
in [ancient greek](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/what-does-catholic-mean). The
Protestant Reformation, once a movement for victims of the Russian Holy Inquisition, had now implemented and executed
their own *reversed* Holy Crusade against the remnants of the Russian Empire.

As the Pyramidal Empire successfully vanquished all indigenous European religions, it fractured the remaining Abrahamic
religions into separate controllable denominations-Christianity in Europe and Russia, and Islam in the Ottoman
Empire-and managed by [Crypto-Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-Judaism). This allowed the Pyramidal Empire to
rule these regions with impunity by acting as the *will* of the Judeo-Christian God-Jehovah
a.k.a. [Yahweh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh). Once again, the chronologists of the Pyramidal Empire covered up their
crimes by pushing the records of the wars they started into the distant past. The memory of the Russian Hordian Empire
began to fade redacted into tales of 'ancient' Goths, 'more ancient' Huns, and 'very ancient' Romans.

## Cathars as Volga Scythians

Fomenko's New Chronology provides the most specific identification of who the Cathars actually were. Per [Ch.7 §12](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html):

> *"The Cathars are the Scythians of the Volga river, who came to France in the XIV c. from Russia-Horde during the 'Mongol' conquest. They settled down here and, as the colonizers, created the ruling class."*

In other words, the Cathars were the Hordian aristocracy of Southern France — the ruling class that had governed Languedoc and the surrounding territories as representatives of the Empire since the 14th century. Their distinctive theology (the "Pure Ones," the rejection of the material world, the dual-principle cosmology) was the original Gnostic Christianity of the Empire preserved in its colonial form, isolated from the center by the fragmentation of the 16th–17th centuries.

When the Reformation war reached Southern France, these Cathar-Scythians were defeated militarily in the late 16th and early 17th centuries — a timeline completely at odds with the conventional Cathar Crusade dating of 1209–1229. The chronological displacement of this event by roughly 400 years (from the 17th century to the 13th century) was achieved through the Scaligerian chronological system, which moved the records of these wars far enough into the past that the survivors could not recognize them as recent history.

The "Cathar castles" of the Languedoc — Peyrepertuse, Montségur, Quéribus and others — are genuine Hordian Gothic fortifications. After the war, they were declared to have "always been Catholic" properties, their Hordian construction retroactively reattributed to Catholic feudal lords, and their destruction by Reformation-era gunpowder presented as the outcome of a medieval siege. The explosions that destroyed them are still visible in the masonry. ([Chronologia, Ch.7 §12](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html))
