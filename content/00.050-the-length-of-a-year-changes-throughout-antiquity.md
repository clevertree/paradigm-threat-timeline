# The length of a Year changes throughout Antiquity

The Earth's orbit changed over time—from the collinear Saturnian configuration (Golden Age) through a series of
electromagnetic close-encounters with Venus and Mars, and into its final stable orbit in modern times.
With each *jump*, the number of days in a calendar year changed dramatically, and ancient cultures worldwide reformed
their calendars to match.

## Solar Year Variables

The following table summarizes each era's calendar parameters and Earth's estimated orbital radius.
All dates are approximate; Scaligerian dates are used as a working framework pending full chronological reconciliation.

## The Mechanism: Plasma Interactions and Orbital Jumps

Each transition in year-length was caused by an electromagnetic close-encounter between Earth and another solar-system
body. When a larger charged body passed sufficiently close, Earth's plasmasphere interacted with it, resulting in
electric repulsion that shifted Earth's orbit outward. The orbital radius increased, which lengthened the year.

The agents of each jump, from Jno Cook's impact table:

| Date | Agent | Event |
|---|---|---|
| ~3,147 BC | Jupiter–Saturn collision | World Flood; Saturn removed from polar axis; 225→240 days |
| ~2,349 BC | Venus (strike near Tibet) | Noah's Flood; Moon appears in sky; 240→260 days |
| ~2,193 BC | Venus | Fall of Akkad / Egyptian Old Kingdom collapse; 260→273 days |
| ~1,492 BC | Venus (strike Central Pacific) | Exodus; 273→360 days |
| ~747 BC | Mars | Era of Nabonassar; 360→365.24 days |
| ~686 BC | Mercury | Sennacherib / Phaethon event |

> Plasma contact between large charged bodies causes electrostatic repulsion. Earth was literally pushed to a slightly
> larger orbit during each near-collision with Venus or Mars, adding days to the year. No collision was required—only
> a close pass through intersecting plasmaspheres.

## Era by Era

### 8,347 – 3,147 BC: The 225-Day Year (Second Creation)

Earth orbited at ~0.72 AU — essentially Venus's current orbital slot — with a 225-day year and no Moon.
The Sumerian King Lists' fantastically large numbers become consistent only under a 225-day year.
See [The length of a year was 225 days](/content/02.110-the-length-of-a-year-was-225-days.md) for full evidence.

### 3,147 – 2,349 BC: The 240-Day Year (Old Kingdom)

The Jupiter–Saturn catastrophe ended the Golden Age. Earth expanded to ~0.75 AU, giving a 240-day year
with four 60-day Chinese seasons. Still no Moon.
See [The length of a year increases to 240 days](/content/03.060-the-length-of-a-year-increases-by-an-additional-15-rotations-to-240-days.md).

### 2,349 – 2,193 BC: The 260-Day Year (Fall of the Absu)

Venus pushed Earth to ~0.79 AU. The Moon appeared for the first time. The Mesoamerican Tzolkin calendar
preserves this exact year-length.
See [The length of a year increases to 260 days](/content/03.070-the-length-of-a-year-increases-by-20-rotations-to-260-days.md).

### 2,193 – 1,492 BC: The 273-Day Year (Middle Kingdom)

A second Venus interaction shifted Earth to ~0.83 AU. Chinese Shang oracle bones record 27–28 day months;
the Mesoamerican 13×21 zodiac totals exactly 273 days.
See [The length of a year increases to 273 days](/content/03.140-the-length-of-a-year-increases-by-13-rotations-to-273-days.md).

### 1,492 – 747 BC: The 360-Day Year (New Kingdom)

The Exodus-era Venus encounter drove Earth to ~0.99 AU. Every ancient civilization independently recorded
12 months of 30 days = 360 days. **The 360 degrees of circular measure we use today is based on this era.**
See [The length of a year jumps to 365 days](/content/03.200-the-length-of-a-year-jumps-by-92-rotations-to-365-days.md)
for the transition out of this era.

### 747 BC – Today: The 365.24-Day Year (Current Era)

Mars enforced the final orbital jump on February 27, 747 BC (Era of Nabonassar). Every calendar-keeping
culture independently added ~5 days to their prior 360-day calendar at the same time.
See [The length of a year jumps to 365.25 days](/content/03.210-the-length-of-a-year-jumps-by-14th-of-a-rotation-to-36525-days.md).

## The Canopus Decree (239 BC): Surviving Evidence of the Prior 360-Day Calendar

In 239 BC, the Greek pharaoh Ptolemy III issued the *Canopus Decree*—engraved in two languages on stone and
found at Tanis, Egypt—ordering the addition of one leap day every four years to correct calendar drift.

The decree is significant because it explicitly refers to **"the year of 360 days and the 5 days added to
their end"**—confirming that Egypt's 365-day calendar was understood as a modified 360-day calendar.
The five epagomenal days were not original; they were appended *after* 747 BC as an adjustment for the
orbital change.

The decree was rejected by the Egyptian priesthood and never implemented—only institutionalized later when
Augustus Caesar imposed the Julian calendar on Egypt in 23 BC.

## Carbon-14 Corroboration

Jno Cook compared the dates calculated using progressively shorter years (going backward through each era)
against the **INTCAL98 radiocarbon calibration table**—and found strong agreement back to the Old Kingdom
period (~4077 BC). The C-14 calibration curve's visible "wiggles" and offsets, long puzzling to
archaeologists, align with the year-length boundary events when adjusted for each era's actual year length.

This is an independent physical corroboration: the radiometric record of atmospheric C-14 (which depends on
solar exposure) is consistent with Earth being closer to the Sun (shorter years, faster orbit) in ancient
times.

## Summary

| Year-length change | Triggering event | Calendar impact |
|---|---|---|
| 225→240 days (~3,147 BC) | Saturn removed / World Flood | 4×60-day Chinese seasons; Sumerian post-flood kings |
| 240→260 days (~2,349 BC) | Venus pass / Noah's Flood | Tzolkin calendar; Moon appears; 10 months of 26 days |
| 260→273 days (~2,193 BC) | Venus pass / Fall of Akkad | Oracle bone months of 27–28 days; 13×21 Mesoamerican zodiac |
| 273→360 days (~1,492 BC) | Venus pass / Exodus | 12 months of 30 days; 360° circle; worldwide reform |
| 360→365.24 days (~747 BC) | Mars / Nabonassar era | 5 epagomenal days added; current calendar established |

The convergence of independent evidence—Sumerian king lists, Chinese oracle bones, Mesoamerican ritual
calendars, Egyptian administrative records, Babylonian astronomical tablets, and Roman calendar structure—all
pointing to the same sequence of year-length changes, constitutes one of the most robust arguments in
alternative chronology research.

## My Personal Theory: Planetary Orbits as Electron Shells

The pattern of Earth's orbital jumps—discrete, quantized leaps between stable orbits triggered by external
electromagnetic encounters—is structurally identical to the behavior of electrons within atoms.

In quantum mechanics, an electron does not drift smoothly from one energy level to another. It absorbs or
emits a discrete quantity of energy and *jumps* instantaneously between fixed orbital shells. Between jumps,
the orbit is stable. The electron cannot occupy an orbit "between" the allowed states. Each shell has a
specific radius and energy. The jump is triggered by an external influence—an incoming photon, a collision,
or an interaction with another charged body's field.

Earth's orbital history follows the same pattern:

- **Discrete stable states**: Each era (225, 240, 260, 273, 360, 365.24 days) represents a stable orbital
  configuration that persisted for centuries or millennia. Earth did not slowly spiral outward; it *jumped*.
- **External trigger required**: Each jump was caused by a close electromagnetic encounter with another
  charged body (Venus, Mars, Jupiter). No jump occurred without an external agent—just as no electron
  transition occurs without an external energy input.
- **Quantized radii**: The orbital radii (0.72, 0.75, 0.79, 0.83, 0.99, 1.00 AU) are not arbitrary.
  They represent allowed stable configurations within the Sun's electric field, analogous to the
  discrete orbital radii of electrons around a nucleus.
- **No intermediate states**: There is no historical evidence of a "234-day year" or a "300-day year."
  The calendar record shows only the discrete allowed states, with abrupt transitions between them.

This is not a metaphor. If scalar energy operates by the same rules at every scale—and if the Electric
Universe model is correct that planets are charged bodies orbiting within the Sun's plasmasphere—then
planetary orbits *are* electron shells, scaled up. The atom is a solar system in miniature; the solar
system is an atom writ large. The same electromagnetic laws governing electron transitions around a nucleus
govern planetary transitions around a star.

The implication is profound: **there is no separate "quantum mechanics" and "celestial mechanics."** There is
one set of rules—scalar energy dynamics—operating identically at the atomic and the cosmic scale. The
apparent divide between quantum physics and classical physics is an artifact of having lost the unified
framework. The ancients, who recorded these orbital jumps in their calendars and myths, were documenting
the same phenomenon that modern physicists observe in their particle accelerators.
