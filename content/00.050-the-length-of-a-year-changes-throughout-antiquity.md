# The length of a Year changes throughout Antiquity

The Earth's orbit changed over time—from the collinear Saturnian configuration (Golden Age) through a series of
electromagnetic close-encounters with Venus and Mars, and into its final stable orbit in modern times.
With each *jump*, the number of days in a calendar year changed dramatically, and ancient cultures worldwide reformed
their calendars to match.

## The Mechanism: Plasma Interactions and Orbital Jumps

Each transition in year-length was caused by an electromagnetic close-encounter between Earth and another solar-system
body. When a larger charged body passed sufficiently close, Earth's plasmasphere interacted with it, resulting in
electric repulsion that shifted Earth's orbit outward. The orbital radius increased, which lengthened the year.

The agents of each jump, from Jno Cook's impact table:

| Date | Agent | Event |
|---|---|---|
| ~3,147 BC | Jupiter–Saturn collision | World Flood; Saturn removed from polar axis; 225→240 days |
| ~2,349 BC | Venus (strike near Tibet) | Noah's Flood; Moon appears in sky; 240→260 days |
| ~2,193 BC | Venus | Fall of Akkad / Egyptian Old Kingdom collapse; 260→273 days |
| ~1,492 BC | Venus (strike Central Pacific) | Exodus; 273→360 days |
| ~747 BC | Mars | Era of Nabonassar; 360→365.24 days |
| ~686 BC | Mercury | Sennacherib / Phaethon event |

> Plasma contact between large charged bodies causes electrostatic repulsion. Earth was literally pushed to a slightly
> larger orbit during each near-collision with Venus or Mars, adding days to the year. No collision was required—only
> a close pass through intersecting plasmaspheres.

## Era by Era

### 8,347 – 3,147 BC: The 225-Day Year (Second Creation)

Earth's orbital radius in this era was approximately 0.72 AU—essentially where Venus now sits. There was no Moon.
The year had only 225 days.

**Evidence:** The Sumerian King Lists recording the reigns of kings *before the flood* contain fantastically large
numbers. These numbers become consistent only when a 225-day year is used to convert them into plausible reigns.
The numbers are not fabricated mythology; they are records in a different timekeeping system.

The coincidence with Venus's current orbit (0.72 AU, period ≈ 225 days) is important: Earth in the Golden Age
occupied the orbital slot Venus now holds. The planet we call Venus arrived in this region later, after a series of
catastrophes displaced bodies from Jupiter's vicinity.

### 3,147 – 2,349 BC: The 240-Day Year (Old Kingdom)

The Jupiter–Saturn polar alignment catastrophe of ~3,147 BC ended the Golden Age. Saturn was removed from its
position directly "above" Earth's north pole. The World Flood followed. Earth's orbit expanded to ~0.75 AU,
giving a 240-day year.

**Evidence:**
- The Sumerian King Lists recording reigns *after the flood* fit a 240-day year.
- Ancient Chinese astronomical records describe four seasons of 60 days each (4 × 60 = 240 days).
- The Chinese *Annals of Shu* (Shujing) record that Emperor Yao sent astronomers to the four cardinal directions
  to measure the year and found it to be 366 days in the *new* era—indicating they were measuring and recording
  the transition, not an existing prior standard.
- There was no Moon yet in this era. The Moon appears in the record only from ~2,349 BC onward.

### 2,349 – 2,193 BC: The 260-Day Year (Fall of the Absu)

A Venus close-approach around 2,349 BC drove Earth further out to ~0.79 AU. The year lengthened to 260 days.
The Moon appeared for the first time, with a period of approximately 26 days, giving roughly 10 months per year.

**Evidence:**
- **Mesoamerican Tzolkin calendar**: The 260-day ritual calendar, still in continuous use today in Guatemala and
  the Yucatan, preserves the year-length of this exact era. It is not an arbitrary invention; it is the count of
  days in an actual solar year from antiquity.
- **Yao (China)**: The Annals of Shu record Yao establishing the calendar with reference to
  "a round year of three hundred, sixty, and six days"—but this was the new post-jump year under observation.
  The jump itself is implicitly documented.
- **Marduk / Enuma Elish (Babylon)**: Marduk is credited with reforming the calendar after establishing order in
  the heavens—a mythological account of the same orbital reorganization.
- **Noah's Flood**: The Genesis flood narrative is associated with this era. The appearance of the Moon, and
  the rainbow (plasma discharge between Venus and Earth), mark this event across multiple cultures.

### 2,193 – 1,492 BC: The 273-Day Year (Middle Kingdom)

A second Venus interaction ~2,193 BC shifted Earth's orbit to ~0.83 AU. The year became 273 days.
The month length settled to 27–28 days; 10 months per year continued.

**Evidence:**
- **Chinese Shang Dynasty oracle bones** record months of 27 and 28 days—a direct astronomical observation
  matching this era's lunar period exactly.
- **Mesoamerican 13-division zodiac**: The 13 divisions of the ancient Mesoamerican sky calendar, each of 21 days,
  total exactly 273 days (13 × 21 = 273). This cannot be coincidence.
- **Egyptian Middle Kingdom**: The collapse of the Old Kingdom (~2,193 BC) and the so-called "First Intermediate
  Period" coincide with this orbital jump. The political disruption in Egypt was accompanied by a sky catastrophe
  that changed the year.
- The 273-day year is also consonant with the duration of human gestation (≈273 days), which many researchers
  believe was originally used to calibrate or name the period.

### 1,492 – 747 BC: The 360-Day Year (New Kingdom)

The 1,492 BC Venus encounter—corresponding to the biblical Exodus from Egypt—drove Earth's orbit to ~0.99 AU,
giving a 360-day year with 12 months of exactly 30 days each.

This is the *most extensively documented* calendar era in ancient history, and the most consequential for
modern measurement:

> **The 360 degrees of circular measure that we use today is based on this era.** Ancient astronomers divided the
> year into 360 equal units; those same units were then applied to geometry and navigation. The full circle = one
> year = 360 days.

**Evidence globally:**
- **Babylon**: The ecliptic was divided into 18 equal sections of 20 degrees (18 × 20 = 360).
  Cuneiform tablets record a 360-day year throughout the Kassite and early Assyrian period.
- **Egypt**: The civil calendar of 12 months × 30 days = 360 days, with 5 "epagomenal" days added later
  *after* 747 BC. The five added days were mythologized as the birthdays of five major gods (Osiris, Horus,
  Set, Isis, Nephthys)—a cultural memory of the calendar reform. The Egyptian sky was divided into 36 *decans*
  of 10 days each (36 × 10 = 360).
- **Rome**: The original Roman calendar had 10 months (not 12), totaling 304 days—a partial preservation
  of the 360-day structure before it was adapted. The calendar's internal evidence points to design around
  shorter years.
- **Mesoamerica**: The Maya Long Count uses the *Tun* (360-day year) as its base unit for long periods,
  even after the year was known to be 365.24 days. They preserved the 360-day year as a deliberate
  chronological tool.
- **India**: The Vedic year was traditionally noted as 360 days, with explicit textual references to
  "the year of 360 days."
- **China**: The sky was divided into 360 *du* (degrees) in the pre-747 BC era; after the jump,
  China readjusted to 365.25 *du*.

The near-simultaneous calendar reform across all these civilizations—each independently adding 5 days to bring
their 360-day calendar to 365—is one of the strongest proofs that the year actually changed in 747 BC.

### 747 BC – Today: The 365.24-Day Year (Current Era)

The final orbital jump occurred around **February 27, 747 BC** (the Era of Nabonassar). Mars, having invaded
Earth's vicinity during the period 776–686 BC, exerted its last major perturbation. Earth moved to its
current orbit at 1.00 AU.

**Evidence:**
- **The Era of Nabonassar** begins on an astronomically fixed date—February 27, 747 BC—which marks a
  calendar reform event used by Mesopotamian and later Greek astronomers (including Ptolemy) as their
  fixed epoch. The reason that specific date was historically significant: the sky changed.
- **The Olmec Long Count** was set to position 6.0.0.0.0 on February 28, 747 BC—independently confirming
  the same calendrical anchor event in Mesoamerica.
- **Universal 5-day addition**: Every calendar-keeping culture added approximately 5 days to their prior
  360-day calendar around the same time (Babylon, Egypt, India, China, Rome).
- **Plutarch's formula**: Plutarch (*Life of Numa*) records that Hermes won 1/70th of each day from the Moon
  (in a game with the Moon god) and created five additional days to add to the year.
  Numerically: 360 × (1/70) ≈ 5.14 days → new year ≈ 365.14 days. This is a mythological encoding of the
  arithmetic of the calendar jump.
- **Mars mythology**: Worldwide myths of a terrifying sky-battle with a red, dragon-like celestial body
  (Tiamat, Typhon, Set, Tlaloc, etc.) describe this era. The Roman god *Mars*, god of war, is named after
  the body that ended the 360-day era and enforced the current orbit.

## The Canopus Decree (239 BC): Surviving Evidence of the Prior 360-Day Calendar

In 239 BC, the Greek pharaoh Ptolemy III issued the *Canopus Decree*—engraved in two languages on stone and
found at Tanis, Egypt—ordering the addition of one leap day every four years to correct calendar drift.

The decree is significant because it explicitly refers to **"the year of 360 days and the 5 days added to
their end"**—confirming that Egypt's 365-day calendar was understood as a modified 360-day calendar.
The five epagomenal days were not original; they were appended *after* 747 BC as an adjustment for the
orbital change.

The decree was rejected by the Egyptian priesthood and never implemented—only institutionalized later when
Augustus Caesar imposed the Julian calendar on Egypt in 23 BC.

## Carbon-14 Corroboration

Jno Cook compared the dates calculated using progressively shorter years (going backward through each era)
against the **INTCAL98 radiocarbon calibration table**—and found strong agreement back to the Old Kingdom
period (~4077 BC). The C-14 calibration curve's visible "wiggles" and offsets, long puzzling to
archaeologists, align with the year-length boundary events when adjusted for each era's actual year length.

This is an independent physical corroboration: the radiometric record of atmospheric C-14 (which depends on
solar exposure) is consistent with Earth being closer to the Sun (shorter years, faster orbit) in ancient
times.

## Summary

| Year-length change | Triggering event | Calendar impact |
|---|---|---|
| 225→240 days (~3,147 BC) | Saturn removed / World Flood | 4×60-day Chinese seasons; Sumerian post-flood kings |
| 240→260 days (~2,349 BC) | Venus pass / Noah's Flood | Tzolkin calendar; Moon appears; 10 months of 26 days |
| 260→273 days (~2,193 BC) | Venus pass / Fall of Akkad | Oracle bone months of 27–28 days; 13×21 Mesoamerican zodiac |
| 273→360 days (~1,492 BC) | Venus pass / Exodus | 12 months of 30 days; 360° circle; worldwide reform |
| 360→365.24 days (~747 BC) | Mars / Nabonassar era | 5 epagomenal days added; current calendar established |

The convergence of independent evidence—Sumerian king lists, Chinese oracle bones, Mesoamerican ritual
calendars, Egyptian administrative records, Babylonian astronomical tablets, and Roman calendar structure—all
pointing to the same sequence of year-length changes, constitutes one of the most robust arguments in
alternative chronology research.

## My Personal Theory: Planetary Orbits as Electron Shells

The pattern of Earth's orbital jumps—discrete, quantized leaps between stable orbits triggered by external
electromagnetic encounters—is structurally identical to the behavior of electrons within atoms.

In quantum mechanics, an electron does not drift smoothly from one energy level to another. It absorbs or
emits a discrete quantity of energy and *jumps* instantaneously between fixed orbital shells. Between jumps,
the orbit is stable. The electron cannot occupy an orbit "between" the allowed states. Each shell has a
specific radius and energy. The jump is triggered by an external influence—an incoming photon, a collision,
or an interaction with another charged body's field.

Earth's orbital history follows the same pattern:

- **Discrete stable states**: Each era (225, 240, 260, 273, 360, 365.24 days) represents a stable orbital
  configuration that persisted for centuries or millennia. Earth did not slowly spiral outward; it *jumped*.
- **External trigger required**: Each jump was caused by a close electromagnetic encounter with another
  charged body (Venus, Mars, Jupiter). No jump occurred without an external agent—just as no electron
  transition occurs without an external energy input.
- **Quantized radii**: The orbital radii (0.72, 0.75, 0.79, 0.83, 0.99, 1.00 AU) are not arbitrary.
  They represent allowed stable configurations within the Sun's electric field, analogous to the
  discrete orbital radii of electrons around a nucleus.
- **No intermediate states**: There is no historical evidence of a "234-day year" or a "300-day year."
  The calendar record shows only the discrete allowed states, with abrupt transitions between them.

This is not a metaphor. If scalar energy operates by the same rules at every scale—and if the Electric
Universe model is correct that planets are charged bodies orbiting within the Sun's plasmasphere—then
planetary orbits *are* electron shells, scaled up. The atom is a solar system in miniature; the solar
system is an atom writ large. The same electromagnetic laws governing electron transitions around a nucleus
govern planetary transitions around a star.

The implication is profound: **there is no separate "quantum mechanics" and "celestial mechanics."** There is
one set of rules—scalar energy dynamics—operating identically at the atomic and the cosmic scale. The
apparent divide between quantum physics and classical physics is an artifact of having lost the unified
framework. The ancients, who recorded these orbital jumps in their calendars and myths, were documenting
the same phenomenon that modern physicists observe in their particle accelerators.
