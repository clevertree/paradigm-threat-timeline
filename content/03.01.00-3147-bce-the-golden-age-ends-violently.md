# The Golden Age Ends Violently.

Within a very short time, all 9 planets (including Earth) break from the configuration and exit the outer layers
of Saturn's protective plasma sheath. The planets, having left Saturn's collinear configuration, violently competed with
each other for a place in a new orbit. They formed
an [in-parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Parallel_circuits)
circular _non-linear_ configuration that together orbits the Sun for the next 1655 years. Humanity encounters a new
unfamiliar influence (*death*) as it enters a period of extended darkness, famine, pestilence, and confusion.
