# Messianic Jewish begins

The emergence of the Messianic Jewish movement in the early 15th century (per the Marfull chronological framework, compressed from a 17th century original) was not a spontaneous religious development but a deliberate theological-political project. The convert Hieronymus de Santa Fe was a Jewish physician named Joshua (Yehoshua) who converted to Christianity and became a weapon in the campaign to absorb the Jewish community into the new Christian-Roman order being consolidated in the wake of the Empire's fragmentation.

His 1412 work *Hebraeomaster* (also called *Habraeomastix*) asserted that the Jewish Messiah had already arrived — in the form of Jesus Christ — and that Jewish rabbis were willfully concealing this truth from their followers. This argument was designed to preempt the most obvious objection to Christian conversion: that Jews were still waiting for a Messiah who had not yet come. By redefining the arrival of the Messiah in historical terms, Santa Fe attempted to close the theological door for Jewish resistance to conversion.

Simultaneously, the appearance of the **Hieronymites** (Order of Saint Jerome) and the promotion of Saint Jerome as the author of the Latin Vulgate Bible served a similar purpose: to establish an authoritative Latin text of Scripture with official dating — providing the chronological backbone for the entire Scaligerian system.
