# Redacted into the Books of Esther / Judith

Fomenko [demonstrates](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html) how this story was redacted into the
modern Bible as the 'ancient' books of [Esther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther)
and [Judith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judith):

> In the Bible it is reflected as the 'massacre of the Persians'. To commemorate this event in the Judaic church the
> famous holiday of Purim was established. The story of Judith clearly shows the traces of the story of Esther already
> familiar to us. A foreigner, a Jewess, infiltrates the court of the 'Persian' king ( **Nebuchadnezzar Ahasuerus**),
> becomes his wife or an 'intimate person'. As a result a son or a close relative of the king – the
> king's co-ruler, tragically dies. It is followed by the massacre of the 'Persians' by the Jews. It is no coincidence
> that in the modern biblical canon the Book of Judith is placed next to the Book of Esther.
