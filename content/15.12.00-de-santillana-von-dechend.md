## Primary Contribution

*Hamlet's Mill* (1969) — the discovery that ancient myth encodes precise astronomical observation, specifically the precession of the equinoxes. This work is directly described by Jno Cook as "the forerunner to the post-Velikovsky polar configuration thesis by David Talbott," and Talbott himself credits it as a primary source.

## Central Argument

- **Myth encodes astronomy, not allegory** — the worldwide distribution of the "mill" metaphor (Hamlet's mill, the Norse Grotti, the Hindu churning of the ocean) is a cross-cultural image for the precessing celestial pole. It is not a harvest metaphor, not a psychological archetype, not a folk tale
- **Ancient peoples tracked planetary motion with precision** over centuries and encoded it in myth, making recovery of that astronomy methodologically legitimate
- **Precession of the equinoxes** is the hidden subject of a vast body of ancient mythology — from the Norse Ragnarök to Ovid's *Metamorphoses* to the Epic of Gilgamesh
- **Methodological foundation** — by demonstrating that myth reliably encodes real astronomical observation, *Hamlet's Mill* made Talbott's Saturn myth reconstruction defensible as evidence-based scholarship rather than speculation

## Relationship to This Timeline

*Hamlet's Mill* is a keystone work: it legitimized the entire approach of reading ancient myth as literal celestial record, which is the foundation of the Saturnian Cosmology framework. Without the de Santillana/von Dechend methodology, the mythological evidence that drives this timeline's earliest chapters could be dismissed as folklore.
