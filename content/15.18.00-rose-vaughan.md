## Primary Contribution

Mathematical proof from Babylonian astronomical records that Venus's orbit was recently disturbed — and the specific derivation of the **685 BCE orbital stabilization date** used throughout this timeline. Their 1974–1980 series of papers analyzing the Venus Tablets of Ammizaduga is the mechanism by which Jno Cook — and independently Velikovsky — arrived at 685 BCE as the close of the cataclysmic era.

## The Venus Tablets Reanalysis

- The 7th-century BCE Babylonian astronomical records encode Venus orbital eccentricities and aphelion positions that have since shifted. Rose and Vaughan showed that normalizing the tablet data against present orbital parameters reveals a systematic residual consistent with a recent orbital disturbance
- **685 BCE stabilization** — their analysis showed Venus's orbit reaching its current configuration around 685 BCE, after which the Babylonian records match present orbital behavior — this is the date this timeline uses as the close of the cataclysmic era
- **Simultaneous Earth-Venus disturbance** — demonstrated that if both Earth and Venus changed orbits during the same event (as Velikovsky proposed), the mathematical residuals in the Babylonian data fit the post-event observation window with a precision not achievable by coincidence

## Significance

Cook explicitly credits Rose and Vaughan as providing the most rigorous astronomical analysis in the Velikovskian literature. Their 685 BCE date is repeated and confirmed across multiple chapters of *Saturnian Cosmology* and is the primary anchor for this timeline's close of the Dark Ages chapter.
