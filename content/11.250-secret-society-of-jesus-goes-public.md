# Secret Society of Jesus goes public

By the early 18th century, the Jesuit Society of Jesus had been operating as a transnational covert organization for nearly two centuries — infiltrating courts, universities, missionary networks, and intelligence channels across every major civilization on Earth. The period of maximum secrecy had been necessary during the consolidation phase of the Reformation. Now, with the Hordian resistance in Russia effectively neutralized by the Romanovs, and the last fragments of Moscow Tartary not yet organized for a counter-attack, the Society moved into its more openly dominating phase.

The treaties of London (1718) and Vienna (1725) represented the formalization of this new order: a coordinated European colonial project that would divide the non-European world between a small number of Western powers, all operating under the theological and financial architecture the Jesuits and the new banking class had constructed. The `Society of Jesus` was the institutional spine connecting these treaty systems — providing the intelligence networks, the trained administrators, the missionaries-as-scouts, and the theological justification for conquest that no purely secular institution could have provided.

Per the Marfull chronological framework:

> the treaties of London - of 1718 - and of Vienna - of 1725 - in which Europe conquers half the world.
