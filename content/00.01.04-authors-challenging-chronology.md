# Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline

The following researchers have made primary, substantial contributions to demonstrating that Scaligerian chronology — the conventional historical timeline — is fabricated, inflated, or systematically wrong.

Their methods vary: mathematical and statistical analysis of historical texts, astronomical reanalysis of ancient eclipse records, re-reading of archaeological stratigraphy, and forensic examination of institutional suppression. What unites them is the conclusion that the dates most people accept for ancient history are, in large part, invented.

**Note:** Several researchers who both challenge the timeline AND interpret ancient sources as cataclysm (Fomenko, Heinsohn, Schoch, Hancock, Cremo) are listed in the companion article — [Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm](00.01.05-authors-cataclysm-texts.md) — because their chronological work cannot be separated from their cataclysm interpretation.

## N. A. Morozov (1854–1946)

Russian mathematician, astronomer, and political prisoner. Morozov was the first scholar to apply systematic astronomical and mathematical methods to demonstrate that standard historical chronology is untenable.

Confined in the Peter and Paul Fortress and later Schlisselburg Prison for 27 years (providing uninterrupted time for study), he produced a 7-volume work analyzing the astronomical content of ancient documents — eclipses, stellar positions, comet appearances — and found that the dates assigned to these events by Scaligerian chronology are mathematically impossible. The astronomical data, re-analyzed without presupposing conventional dates, consistently yields dates in the medieval period, not classical antiquity.

Morozov's conclusions:
- **Most of classical antiquity is an illusion** — the "ancient" eclipse records, stellar catalogues, and historical chronicles date to the early medieval period
- **The Old Testament is a medieval document** — its astronomical content is inconsistent with 1st millennium BCE dates
- **Ancient Greece and Rome** as standardly dated do not have astronomical records consistent with their asserted periods

His work directly inspired Fomenko. Morozov never fully developed the implications into a complete revised chronology; that project fell to Fomenko and his collaborators.

## Heribert Illig (b. 1947)

German independent historian and publisher whose 1991 book *Das erfundene Mittelalter* (*The Invented Middle Ages*) proposed that the years 614–911 CE were deliberately inserted into the historical record — creating 297 phantom years — by a conspiracy of Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII to place their reign at the symbolic millennium.

The evidential core:
- **No unambiguous archaeological or astronomical evidence** independently dates to 614–911 CE
- **Carolingian architecture** attributed to the phantom period shows stylistic anachronisms
- **Calendar drift** — the Julian calendar's accumulated error by 1582 should be larger than it was, given the assumed ~1,600 years elapsed; the shortfall matches the phantom 297 years

Illig focuses on deliberate political forgery rather than Fomenko's error-accumulation model. The two frameworks are broadly compatible — both identify a fabricated early medieval gap — but propose different mechanisms.
