# N. A. Morozov

![Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov](/media/16/na-morozov.png)

**Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov** (1854–1946) was a Russian revolutionary, scientist, and polymath whose
astronomical approach to biblical and historical texts made him a foundational precursor to the modern
[New Chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chronology_(Fomenko)) developed by Anatoly Fomenko.
He spent years imprisoned in the [Shlisselburg Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlisselburg_Fortress),
during which he produced much of his most significant scholarship. His work spans chemistry, physics,
astronomy, linguistics, and history.

## The Revelation in Storm and Thunder (1907)

*Otkrovenie v groze i bure* — published shortly after his release from Shlisselburg — proposes a radical,
secular, and astronomical interpretation of the Biblical Book of Revelation.

**Core thesis:** Morozov argued that the Book of Revelation is not a prophecy of the end times, but rather a
symbolic record of a specific astronomical event observed by the text's author — whom he argued was
[John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom).

**The date:** Using astronomical calculations, Morozov claimed to have identified the exact date represented
by the stellar imagery in Revelation as **September 30, 395 AD** (Julian calendar), based on observations of
the constellation over [Patmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patmos).

**The interpretation:** The vivid imagery of the apocalypse — the four horsemen, the dragon, the woman
clothed with the sun — are read as allegories for the sun, moon, planets, and constellations (Scorpio, Libra,
Leo) as they appeared during a solar eclipse on that date.

**Reception:** The work was considered highly controversial and was added to the index of prohibited books
by the Russian Orthodox clergy in 1908.

**Significance:** A pioneering work of astro-historical analysis that attempts to "demythologize" religious
texts by anchoring them in natural phenomena.

> Note: The Russian title is also translated as *"Revelation in Thunderstorm and Tempest"* or
> *"The Revelation to John: An Astronomic Historical Investigation"*.

## Prophets (Пророки, 1914)

A 1914 work applying Morozov's astronomical methods to analyze biblical texts, written as a continuation of
*The Revelation in Storm and Thunder*.

**Methodology:** Morozov argued that many historical events — particularly those in the Bible — were misdated
because they were based on false or misread astronomical data. He cross-checked textual descriptions against
reconstructed sky positions to identify the actual dates behind the narratives.

**Significance:** *Prophets* laid the groundwork for his comprehensive seven-volume series *Khristos*
(1924–1932), which detailed his revised, condensed timeline of history. While considered pseudohistory by
mainstream academics, it is foundational to the Russian New Chronology movement.

## Khristos (Христос, 1924–1932)

*Khristos: istoriya chelovechestva v estestvennonauchnom osveshchenii*
("Christ: History of Mankind in the Light of Natural Sciences") is Morozov's magnum opus — a seven-volume
work produced partly during his imprisonment — a comprehensive attempt to overhaul traditional historical
chronology using methods from astronomy, physics, and mathematics.

**Core thesis (New Chronology):** Morozov argued that the accepted chronology of ancient and medieval history
was significantly flawed. He proposed that much of early history was fabricated, with many ancient events
actually occurring much later in the Middle Ages.

**Astronomical methodology:** A core component is using the dates of astronomical events — eclipses,
planetary conjunctions — mentioned in ancient texts to determine the real time of the events. He analyzed
ancient religious texts, including the Book of Revelation, through a scientific, astronomical lens.

**Reinterpretation of religion:** Morozov argued that many biblical events and figures, including Jesus Christ,
were not historical in the traditional sense, but rather allegorical figures representing astronomical
phenomena or earlier events.

**Structure:** The seven-volume set covers various aspects of human history, with a focus on re-evaluating
the timeline of Mediterranean and European civilizations.

**Influence:** While considered pseudoscientific by mainstream academia, *Khristos* is significant as a
direct precursor to the modern New Chronology developed by [Anatoly Fomenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Fomenko).

## Physical Examination of Codex Sinaiticus

Morozov had the rare opportunity to personally handle [Codex Sinaiticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)
in the manuscript department of the Public Library (St. Petersburg), and recorded his observations in
*Prophets* (*Пророки*, 1914), pp. 258–260. His findings became a key early argument against the manuscript's
claimed 4th-century date.

**On the condition of the parchment:**

> "Upon careful examination of the Codex Sinaiticus in the manuscript department of the Public Library, my
> attention was first of all drawn to the fact that the parchment sheets of this document were not at all
> frayed at the lower corners, not dirty or soiled by fingers, as should have been the case with a thousand
> years of use."
>
> — N. A. Morozov, *Prophets* (1914), p. 258

**On the photographic reproductions (Kirsopp Lake editions):**

> "On the phototype images taken from it, published in England, the pages appear **much dirtier than they
> really are**."
>
> — *Prophets*, p. 259

Morozov noted this discrepancy as suspicious — suggesting the English photographic editions were deliberately
processed to give the manuscript a more convincingly "aged" appearance than the actual object warranted.

**On flexibility of the parchment:**

> "What seems especially interesting to me is the internal condition of the parchment of the Codex
> Sinaiticus. Its sheets are very thin, beautifully crafted and, what is most amazing, they **have retained
> their flexibility** — they have not become fragile at all! And this circumstance is very important for
> determining antiquity. When we deal with documents that have really lain for a millennium, even under
> the best climatic conditions, then often at the slightest touch to their sheets, they break into tiny
> pieces..."
>
> — *Prophets*, p. 260

**On the torn binding and outer sheets:**

> "...the condition of the internal sheets of the Codex Sinaiticus with obvious traces of careless handling
> by the monks, who tore off its binding and tore off the outer sheets."
>
> — *Prophets*, p. 260

Morozov observed that the binding and outermost sheets — which would normally carry the manuscript's issue
data (where, when, and by whom it was made) — were missing. He raised the possibility that the binding was
removed not by monks but by Tischendorf himself, to conceal evidence of the manuscript's actual date of
production. This was consistent with the Tischendorf acquisition story itself, which Morozov found
suspicious: Tischendorf claimed to have found sheets of the manuscript discarded *in a basket intended for
burning* by monks at St. Catherine's Monastery — while the surviving leaves were found to be in
exceptionally fine condition.

**The 1933 sale:**

After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government sold the Codex Sinaiticus to the British Museum in 1933
for £100,000 sterling — without the Russians having publicly contested its antiquity, despite Morozov's
findings having been in print since 1914. Russian forum commentary (d3.ru, 2009) speculated this reflected a
calculated political transaction rather than genuine belief in the manuscript's authenticity.

**Related observation by Porfiry Uspensky (1845):**

Bishop [Porfiry Uspensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porfiry_Uspensky), who visited St. Catherine's
Monastery in 1845 — the same year as Tischendorf's first visit — wrote that the manuscript's script was
*"completely similar to Church Slavonic"* (*First Journey to the Sinai Monastery*, Petersburg 1856, p. 226).
This observation has since been cited as corroborating Morozov's scepticism about the date.

**Significance:** Morozov's hands-on physical inspection is one of the earliest documented scholarly
challenges to the conventional 4th-century dating of Sinaiticus, predating modern debates by decades and
directly influencing Fomenko and Nosovsky's treatment of the manuscript in *Biblical Rus'* (1998).
