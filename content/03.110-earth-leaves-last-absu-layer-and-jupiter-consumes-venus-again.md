# Earth leaves last Absu layer and Jupiter consumes Venus again

This new period of stability lasts another 156 years and ends abruptly when the nonlinear configuration loses its last
Absu layer. Exposed to the Sun's electromagnetic field, each planet forms its
own [magnetosphere](http://www.plasmacosmology.net/tech.html). Seasons begin on Earth for the first time. The formations
of deserts during this period force the populations of Western Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and North Africa to
migrate. The Egyptian and [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) kingdoms collapse. The Earth is
still in the nonlinear orbit with Jupiter, and the year extends to 273 days. It would be another 200 years before Egypt
repopulates beginning the [Middle Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt) period. As Venus
becomes exposed to the Sun's field, it retreats into the safety of Jupiter's magnetosphere, and becomes once again
_consumed into the Gas Giant's interior_.
