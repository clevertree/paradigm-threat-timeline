# Cosmic Life Cycle

We are taught in school that our Universe began with a
[Big Bang](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/opinion/cosmos/cosmology-crisis-webb-telescope.html),
however every prediction by this popular theory has been
[refuted](https://www.lppfusion.com/science/cosmic-connection/plasma-cosmos/cosmos/cosmology/the-growing-case-against-the-big-bang/)
by more available data since the 1990s. And yet, every civilization that remembers the Golden Age described it as having
started with a "big bang" or incredible brightness. Therefore, a *Big Bang* event indicates the moment of *rebirth* in
the life cycle of each Solar System, rather than in the entire Universe. The life cycle of our Solar System is as follows:

First, our Sun [converts](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Nuclear_fusion_in_the_Sun)
light gasses to heavy elements which fall to the Sun's interior and combine into a
[proto-planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanet) with lightning scars across the surface (and no life yet)
orbiting the Sun from the *inside*. As it grows in mass, energy from the Sun charges the *proto-planet*, like a
capacitor, forcing it to develop hollow spheres within to contain the energy. This in turn generates a stronger
[magnetic field](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/planetary-magnetic-field) around it.

    of our Sun and heading to the outer solar system.

Next, after a *proto-planet* has become too big and energetic to sustain a stable orbit within a Sun, it forces its way
out and is [violently born](https://www.bitchute.com/video/qDnih8aLae1w) out of the Sun's
surface (also known as a [coronal mass ejection](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna46725245)).
As a *proto-planet* rips away from the Sun's surface and forms its own EM field,
the positively-charged outer shell of the proto-planet's EM field pushes it away from the Sun's
positive environment, and shoots past the [outer solar system](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/outer-solar-system/)
(where the debris of many dead planets can be found) and drifts through outer space falling towards the largest nearest negative surface charge - like the Brown Dwarf Saturn. Once the Brown Dwarf is impregnated with the proto-planet, the Dwarf's charge changes and it falls towards the nearest positive body - our Sun.

In order to become a planet, a *proto-planet* must then be consumed by a larger host body and carried back to the Sun.
Proto-Earth was consumed by the *brown dwarf* Proto-Saturn and carried into our Sun's orbit — the moment of our
planet's *conception*. See [Before Creation](/content/01.00.00-5000-bce-before-creation.md) for the full account of Saturn's
brown dwarf era and the long darkness before Creation.

Unable to contain the smaller charging bodies within it the plasma Sheath exploded, creating all the gas planets, and
pouring plasma and solid material into the Sun's orbit. This material coalesced and polarized around
[Birkeland currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_current)
forming the moons and rock planets (Mercury and Mars), and forcing all planets into a
[collinear configuration](http://qdl.scs-inc.us/2ndParty/Pages/11007.html) connected at their poles.
This high-energy idyllic period is remembered as the Golden Age for any planet - a time when all forms of life
are created.

The planets continue to grow and eventually the collinear system breaks up into a non-linear 'round-table' system marked
by [epic cataclysms](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/632271) spanning the "Dark Ages" (i.e. Old Testament).
After the instability is resolved, the planets violently break away from each other and eventually find their final
orbits around our Sun. The cataclysms come to an end and modern history begins (i.e. New Testament).

After many thousands of years of stable orbits, each planet loses density and conductivity and drifts towards the outer
solar system, slowly at first, but increasing in speed until it finally [rips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip)
its way out of our solar system and dies, along with all remaining life on it. At this point the Sun's system has
become empty and ready for another cycle to begin.

## Theoretical Context and Related Views

The model described above — a **short cosmic life cycle** operating at the Solar System scale, not the universal scale — is an original synthesis. No known published cosmologist or mythologist has stated it in exactly this form. It is developed from the convergence of Saturnian Cosmology, Electric Universe theory, and ancient testimony. Readers familiar with [Wal Thornhill](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2012/03/20/the-electric-universe/) and the [EU framework](https://www.holoscience.com/wp/electric-universe-predictions/) may infer that such a view is consistent with their model of stellar and planetary formation, but Thornhill has not (as of this writing) explicitly stated that Solar Systems undergo a birth-death-rebirth cycle of the kind described here.

### Closest Existing Theories

#### Gap Theory (Ruin-Restitution)

The theory most aligned with the cosmic life cycle view is the **Gap Theory**, also called *Ruin-Restitution*, which holds that an indefinite interval — potentially billions of years — exists between [Genesis 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=KJV) ("In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth") and [Genesis 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=KJV) ("And the earth was without form, and void"). Proponents argue that the Hebrew *tohu wa-bohu* ("formless and empty") in verse 2 implies a *ruined* state, not an original one — meaning the cosmos existed *before* Genesis, was destroyed, and was then *recreated* in six days.

This aligns with the cosmic life cycle model in one key respect: **the universe or solar system was already there before Genesis**. The narrative of creation is not the origin of matter but a *rebirth* following catastrophe. Early proponents of Gap Theory include the theologian [Thomas Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Chalmers) (1814) and [G.H. Pember](https://archive.org/details/earthsearliestag00pembuoft) in *Earth's Earliest Ages* (1876), and it was popularized in the annotated [Scofield Reference Bible](https://archive.org/details/holybiblescofield00scof) (1909).

#### Young Universe Creationism (YUC)

Young Universe Creationism interprets the six days of Genesis literally and applies them to the *entire cosmos*, placing the age of the universe at roughly 6,000–10,000 years. Advocates such as [Ken Ham](https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/age-of-the-universe/) of Answers in Genesis argue that all stellar and planetary formation happened within this window. While the short cosmic life cycle model agrees that the *current cycle* affecting Earth may be young — consistent with Fomenko and Saturnian timelines — it does not require the *universe itself* to be young: prior cycles may have preceded our own.
