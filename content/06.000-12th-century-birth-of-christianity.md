# 12th Century C.E. Birth of Christianity

In Fomenko’s New Chronology, the first widely recorded and _purely human_ event was the crucifixion of Andronicus Christ
in 1185. Biographies of Czar-Grad's ‘Byzantine’ Emperor Andronicus and the Great Russian
Prince [Andrey Bogoliubsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Bogolyubsky) exist as surviving testimonies about the
historical Christ which match up nicely to the redacted New Testament literature put out by the Catholic Church, but
differ in many significant details. For example, Christ was of
a [race of hairy human giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP1ryzrzjAU) similar to the
mythical [Sasquatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot).
He was born in the year 1152 AD *(rather than around 4 BC)*, in modern day Crimea (rather than Palestine), and his
mother Katya (later renamed Mary in the Latin bible) was born in Cathaya, a far eastern region of Tartaria, and was
buried in the Crimea.

During this period, the Deep State Holy Empire spanned from Western Europe to Istanbul with Jerusalem #1 as their
capital. Their slow-and-go plan was to spread a centralized usury religion based on redacted old-testament narratives
and an invisible creator lord which their priests spoke for. This plan was foiled in less than a decade by Christ
as this “prodigal child” returned triumphantly to Jerusalem proselytizing an anti-establishment
religion promising freedom from tyranny and an end to usury. This forced the hand of the Deep State which saw no other
option than to crucify Christ in a gruesome public display within the tall gates of Troy. The objective of the
crucifixion was to put down his insurrection and make an example of its leader.
