## London's Rebuilding and the New Financial Order

The political aftermath of the Great Fire is as significant as the fire itself. When the rebuilding plan was implemented, the medieval guildhall structure and warren of organic property rights that had defined the old City of London was replaced with a more regularized street grid — conveniently amenable to the new financial architecture being planned. The Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666, passed in the same year as the fire, created the legal presumption that any person absent from their estate for seven years could be declared legally dead, with their estate administered by others. The long-term implications of this for property law, inheritance, and the formation of the financial trusts that now govern Western institutional life have never been fully traced.

## The NC Context: England as the New Financial Metropoly

In Fomenko's reconstruction ([Ch.7 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html)), England's rise to global financial dominance was not organic — it was funded by the stolen treasury of the Hordian Empire, moved to the British Isles specifically because they were geographically remote from Russia-Horde and any potential imperial restoration. The Fire of London served this project by destroying the physical evidence of the old order (87 churches, the medieval Guildhall, St. Paul's Cathedral, thousands of private records) and forcing a complete legal and financial reset. The Royal Exchange, one of the few institutions that might have anchored an independent financial system, was among the structures destroyed.

The fact that Charles II — himself restored to power only six years earlier — attempted to insert royal troops into the City during the crisis, and was blocked by the City Magistrates, illustrates how thoroughly London's financial elite had already consolidated their independence from the Crown. Within twenty-eight years, the Bank of England would formalize that independence into institutional law.
