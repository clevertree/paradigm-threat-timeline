# Romanovs-Zakharyin-Yurievs Dynasty takes the throne

In 1613, the Romanov dynasty, exploiting the disunity caused by the Oprichnina revolt, ascend to the throne-marking
the end of the old Russian dynasty whose bloodline leads back to their first Tsar-Andronicus Christ. The loyal and
defiant troops of the Hordian Empire were banished far from [Moscovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy). These
Cossack regions still exist today and represent the *legacy of Russia-Horde*. For example,
Kazakhstan === Cossack-Stan, i.e. a Cossack region.

## False Dmitry: The True Heir

The Romanov version of history insists that the man who briefly ruled Russia as Dmitry I was a fraud — a monk, Grigory Otrepiev, impersonating the dead Czarevich. The New Chronology disagrees. Per Fomenko's analysis ([Ch.7 §5](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html)), the crowds who greeted him, the Boyars who accepted him, and — crucially — his own mother who publicly acknowledged him all recognized Dmitry as legitimate. It was the Romanovs who invented the "impostor" label after the fact, in order to justify their own coup.

When Dmitry was killed and his son hanged from the Spassky Gate, the last clear-blooded heir of the old dynasty was eliminated. The Romanovs then forged a genealogy connecting themselves to the old Rurikid line and presented Mikhail Romanov's 1613 election as a restoration of legitimate rule. Fomenko is explicit:

> *"ELECTING MIKHAIL ROMANOV TO BECOME THE CZAR HAPPENED SIMPLY TO BE UNLAWFUL, as the son of the actual former Czar was still alive."*

The implications are significant: every subsequent Romanov claim to divine or hereditary right rested on a fabrication.

## From Tutankhamun to Czarevich Dmitry

In what may be one of the most striking identifications in the New Chronology, Fomenko argues that the famous Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun was in fact Czarevich Dmitry himself. The last Hordian czars, he argues, were buried in an Imperial cemetery in Egypt — the same site later discovered by Western archaeologists and presented to the world as "ancient Egyptian" tombs. This identification explains the sudden royal burial of a young man, his elaborate grave goods, and the deliberate obscuring of his identity in the official record.

## The Cross, the Crescent, and the Star

Prior to the Empire's fragmentation in the 17th century, the cross and crescent were a *single* Christian symbol — two aspects of the same religious tradition. The Viennese St. Stephen's Cathedral bore a crescent on its spire until 1685, when it was replaced with a cross as the new Catholic identity was being hardened. The split of the Empire's religious symbol into three distinct forms — the Orthodox cross, the Islamic crescent-and-star, and the Jewish six-pointed star — directly mirrors the political fracturing of the Empire into three successor zones: Orthodox Russia, Ottoman Turkey, and the new Kabbalistic-influenced banking republics of Western Europe.
