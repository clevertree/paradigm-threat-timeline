## Primary Contribution

Geological re-dating of the Great Sphinx to at least 7,000–10,000 BCE based on water erosion analysis — coming from within academic geology. In later work, Schoch connected the evidence to a massive solar plasma outburst as the cause of the older civilization's destruction.

Schoch is an associate professor of natural science at Boston University. His geological credentials make his reanalysis of the Sphinx significantly harder to dismiss than claims from outside mainstream geology.

## The Sphinx Water Erosion

In 1991, Schoch announced that the Great Sphinx shows water erosion patterns consistent with prolonged heavy rainfall — a climate that last existed in Egypt no earlier than 7,000 BCE and possibly 10,000 BCE. This is three to five times the conventional construction date (~2500 BCE).

- The vertical undulating erosion channels in the Sphinx enclosure are consistent with thousands of years of heavy rainfall, not wind erosion or the brief rains of the last 4,000 years
- The Sphinx body and enclosure walls show the same erosion pattern, meaning the enclosure pre-dates the current arid Egyptian climate
- This pushes the Sphinx's construction into the pre-Dynastic or even pre-agricultural era

## The Solar Outburst Hypothesis

In later work (*Forgotten Civilization*, 2012), Schoch argued:
- A massive solar plasma outburst around 9,700–9,600 BCE ended the last ice age catastrophically
- This destroyed an earlier advanced civilization (Atlantis / proto-civilization) that left the Sphinx
- Ancient lightning bolt art, petroglyphs, and megalithic site destruction connect to this solar plasma event
- The plasma model aligns directly with the EU catastrophist framework of Thornhill and Talbott

## Does Both

Schoch **challenges chronology** (re-dates the Sphinx geologically) and **interprets evidence as world cataclysm** (solar plasma destroyed earlier civilization). He appears in both categories:

- → [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](../00.01.04-authors-challenging-chronology.md)
- → [Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm](../00.01.05-authors-cataclysm-texts.md)
