# The "Hundred Years War" begins

As a result of this conquest, many vassal states formed across the planet. Some states were created by peaceful means
and rewarded by retaining their autonomy. Others were forged by warfare, conscription, and taxes. Inevitably
micro-injustices within the Empire caused pockets of resistance, forming the basis
of [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism). The Hordian campaign would drag on in these regions
leading to a war lasting over [a hundred years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War).
