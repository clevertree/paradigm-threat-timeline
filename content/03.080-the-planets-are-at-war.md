# The Planets are at war.

With each violent interplanetary action, the Brown Dwarf Saturn continues to lose its influence over the other
planets. Jupiter hurtles violent plasma discharges seen from Earth which strike Saturn. This exchange was
the [Cosmic Thunderbolt](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/01/22/eu2017-the-cosmic-thunderbolt/)
which brought the planets into electrical balance within a new _nonlinear_ configuration. Jupiter's assault upon Saturn
forces the latter to once again shift polarity and eject all consumed planets. This ends Saturn's influence and begins
the reign of Jupiter. Saturn begins a journey into its final orbit in the outer solar system. The new nonlinear "Round
Table" configuration dominated by "King" Jupiter kept the planets (knights) close together in a circular mini-orbit
which altogether orbits the Sun. This new configuration would be remembered in the Arthurian Legend
of [Camelot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot)
along with the period of peace that followed.

The recently discharged Absu layers of Saturn still surround the non-linear configuration. The planets within endure
violent cataclysm as they vie for a position within the configuration. Icelandic Epos present the battle of Mars and
Venus as a fight between the wolf Fenris and the serpent Midgard. Mars again appears as a hard sphere, but Venus
appears as a comet with long disheveled hair. Scandinavians recall
the [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)
or Weltumspanner, as it “Stretched-around-the-Earth” and ate its own tail. Mars competes with Earth's orbit and is seen
visiting Earth as [Horus](https://www.ancient.eu/Horus/)
10 times over the next 300 years.
