# Author Profiles

This section collects individual biographical and research profiles for every researcher cited in this investigation. These are the scholars, scientists, and independent investigators whose work forms the evidentiary and theoretical foundation of this timeline.

Each profile describes:
- The researcher's primary contribution to catastrophist or chronological revision scholarship
- Their key methods and findings
- The relationship of their work to other authors in this network
- Key works and references

## Categorization

Researchers in this section fall into two broad categories, though many straddle both:

### Those Who Challenge the Mainstream Timeline
Researchers whose primary contribution is demonstrating that the received historical chronology is fabricated, inflated, or systematically wrong — through mathematical, astronomical, stratigraphic, or archaeological evidence.

→ See also: [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](../00.01.01-authors-challenging-chronology.md)

### Those Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm
Researchers whose primary contribution is demonstrating that ancient myth, scripture, art, geology, and archaeology record literal planetary and cosmic catastrophes — events that happened within historical or proto-historical memory.
