# The Hijacking of Communism: Why the Deep State Had to Impose Its Own Version

## The Threat Was Never Communism — It Was *Uncontrolled* Communism

The word "communism" today conjures a specific set of images: gulags, secret police, forced collectivisation, mass starvation, one-party dictatorship, the crushing of religion and spiritual life, and the systematic murder of anyone who dissented. This is what we were given. But it is not what communism had to be, and the people who gave it to us knew that perfectly well.

**Communism** — in its original sense of communal ownership, shared resources, and collective self-governance — is one of the oldest and most natural forms of human economic organisation. It existed in ancient Egypt. It existed in Mesopotamia. It existed in pre-Columbian Peru. It existed in the Russian *mir* and *obshchina* (village communes) that survived into the 19th century. It recurs in every civilisational cycle because it is a **natural phase of economic development**, not an ideology invented by a 19th-century pamphleteer in the British Museum Reading Room.

This is precisely why it was dangerous. Not dangerous to the people living under it — dangerous to the **financial aristocracy** that had spent centuries building centralised control over European economies through banking, debt, and imperial monopoly. If communism emerged organically — as it always had — it would produce self-governing communities that owed nothing to international finance, required no central banking apparatus, and could not be controlled through debt. The deep state needed communism to exist, because the impulse toward it was unstoppable. But they needed it to exist **on their terms**: violent, centralised, atheist, and administered by a party apparatus they could infiltrate and direct.

That is what Marxism was for. And that is what **Ivan Germanovich Kinkel** (1883–1945) proved — without intending to — when he demonstrated that communism was a naturally recurring economic form that required no revolution, no vanguard party, and no destruction of existing culture to emerge.

## What Kinkel Actually Discovered

In 1921, Kinkel published his 312-page masterwork: *"Attempt at Constructing a New Theory of Economic Development of Cultural Mankind"* (completed 1918, published in Sofia). It was the product of a mind that Marx could never have matched — encyclopaedic, interdisciplinary, drawing on economics, sociology, psychology, biology, history, ethnography, and philosophy simultaneously.

Where Marx proposed a crude linear progression — primitive communism → slavery → feudalism → capitalism → communism — Kinkel demonstrated that economic development operates on **two levels simultaneously**:

**Level 1: Three Great Cultural Cycles (Eras)**

| Cycle | Civilisations | Period |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| I | Egyptian, Babylonian, Peruvian, ancient Chinese | ~5000 to ~550 BCE |
| II | Greek–Roman | ~1800 BCE to 5th century CE |
| III | West and East European (Slavic) | Medieval period onward |

**Level 2: Four Economic Forms (recurring within each cycle)**

| Form | Type | Character |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Family / corporate-collectivist / **communist** | Organic, communal, self-governing |
| 2 | Petty-individual | Small-scale private enterprise |
| 3 | Capitalist (agrarian, commercial, industrial) | Concentrated private ownership |
| 4 | State-collectivist | Centralised planning and administration |

The critical discovery: **Form 1 — the communist form — naturally recurs at the beginning of every civilisational cycle.** It is not the end of history (as Marx claimed) but the *beginning* of each new era. It appears organically whenever a civilisation renews itself, carrying forward the achievements of the previous cycle into a new communal phase that then differentiates into individual, capitalist, and state forms.

This is not linear progress toward utopia. It is not cyclical repetition. It is a **spiral** — forward movement driven by technology and population, combined with recurring patterns driven by the interplay of productive forces, consumption forces, and cultural needs.

## Why This Was Intolerable to the Controllers

Kinkel's model was a death sentence for the Marxist project — not because it disproved communism, but because it proved communism **did not need Marx**. Consider what Kinkel demonstrated:

### 1. Communism Is Natural and Does Not Require Revolution

The communist form (Form 1) appeared in every civilisational cycle without anyone writing a manifesto, organising a vanguard party, or murdering the bourgeoisie. It emerged from the organic development of human societies. The Russian village commune was a living example — a self-governing economic unit that managed land collectively, resolved disputes internally, and required no central authority.

This was the deep state's nightmare. If people understood that communal self-governance was the *natural starting point* of civilisation — not something that had to be violently imposed — then the entire Marxist apparatus of revolution, party dictatorship, and centralised control became unnecessary. And unnecessary means uncontrollable.

### 2. Violent Revolution Was a Feature, Not a Bug

Marx's central prophecy — that capitalism must be overthrown through violent revolution — was not a scientific prediction. It was a **political prescription**. Kinkel's model shows that transitions between economic forms occur through multiple mechanisms, and that the patterns carry **continuity** from one era to the next:

> Each new culture, instead of starting from scratch, "steps on what has been already achieved, which in turn smoothes the development at the beginning and gives better prospects for innovation" (Kinkel 1921, p. 282).

Evolution is possible. The old does not need to be burned. The **biogenetic law of development** means each new phase **incorporates** the achievements of the previous one. Marx's insistence on total destruction was never a feature of historical analysis — it was a feature of the **demolition script** his backers required. The deep state needed the transition to communism to be violent because violence destroys existing institutions, existing knowledge, existing spiritual traditions — everything that might allow communities to self-organise outside central control. Peaceful, organic communism would have left those structures intact. That was unacceptable.

### 3. Marx's Economics Was Deliberately Reductive

Marx insisted that economic relations (the "base") determine everything else (the "superstructure"). Kinkel demonstrated with vast historical evidence that this was not merely incomplete but deliberately misleading:

> "To contemporary sociology [...] such a faith or dogma already appear to be absolutely impossible. From the perspective of the entire contemporary knowledge of society we must acknowledge the outdatedness of the view about the existence of only one such factor." — Kinkel, *Methods of Knowledge of Contemporary Sociology* (1931)

Economic development, Kinkel showed, is simultaneously shaped by:
- **Productive forces** (Marx's sole focus)
- **Consumption forces** (what people actually need and desire)
- **Cultural needs** (spiritual, artistic, ethical, scientific aspirations)
- **Psychological factors** (individual and social psychology)
- **Biological factors** (population dynamics, geography, climate)
- **Legal and political structures**
- **Religious and ethnic traditions**

Remove any one of these and your theory collapses. Marx removed all but one and called it science. But this was not intellectual failure — it was **design**. By reducing human society to economics alone, Marxism stripped away precisely those dimensions — spiritual, cultural, psychological, ethnic — that give communities the strength to govern themselves. A people with strong religious traditions, cultural identity, and spiritual life do not need a Party to tell them how to live. A people reduced to mere economic units — interchangeable labour inputs with no God, no tradition, no cultural memory — are helpless without central direction. That is what Marxism was designed to produce.

### 4. Capitalism Was Never the Unique Villain

For Marx, capitalism was the great monster of modernity — unprecedented, uniquely evil, requiring apocalyptic destruction. Kinkel showed it was merely economic **Form 3**, appearing in every civilisational cycle: agrarian capitalism in Egypt (3300–2000 BCE), commercial capitalism in Greece and Rome, feudal capitalism in medieval Europe, industrial capitalism in the modern West.

This demolishes the urgency of the Marxist narrative. If capitalism is a natural, recurring phase that always gives way to the next form, then there is nothing uniquely catastrophic about it — and the transition away from it does not require the apocalyptic violence Marx prescribed. It happened organically in Egypt. It happened in Rome. It can happen again through the natural evolution of productive, consumptive, and cultural forces. But organic transition does not serve the deep state. Organic transition leaves existing power structures, religious institutions, cultural memories, and self-governing communities intact. Only violent revolution clears the board for a **new** centralised authority — one controlled from above.

## The Biogenetic Law vs. Dialectical Materialism

Kinkel proposed the **biogenetic law of social development** (drawing on Ernst Haeckel's biological principle): just as an organism recapitulates the evolutionary history of its species during development, so too do newer civilisations recapitulate the economic forms of older ones before advancing into new territory.

This is the opposite of Marx's dialectical materialism, which posits violent contradiction as the engine of history. In Kinkel's model, development is driven by **accumulation and acceleration** — each new economic activity (banking, transport, communications) passes through the same phases as preceding ones, but faster. This bears an "astonishing resemblance" to modern theories of **fractality** (Mandelbrot): self-similar patterns recurring at different scales and accelerating through time.

The implications are devastating to the controllers: the future is not predetermined by iron laws of contradiction requiring violent intervention. It is shaped by the complex interaction of all the factors that make human societies what they are. To reduce this to economics alone is, as Kinkel wrote, to believe in a "universal phlogiston." And yet that phlogiston was exactly what was needed — a pseudo-scientific justification for destroying organic communities and replacing them with a centrally managed apparatus that answered, ultimately, to the same financial interests that funded Marx in the first place.

## The Pattern: Co-opt, Corrupt, Control

The communal impulse is ancient. Kinkel traced it from Egyptian collectivism through Plato, through Thomas More and Campanella, through Saint-Simon and Fourier, and eventually to Marx. But there was a critical break in this chain. The earlier thinkers — More, Campanella, Saint-Simon, Fourier — imagined communal societies that preserved spiritual life, cultural traditions, and organic community structures. Marx took their vision, **stripped out** everything that made it human, and replaced it with a mechanistic, atheist, economically reductive programme that:

1. **Required violent revolution** — destroying existing communities and institutions
2. **Eliminated religion and spirituality** — removing the strongest source of communal identity outside state control
3. **Centralised all authority in a party apparatus** — replacing organic self-governance with top-down dictatorship
4. **Reduced human beings to economic units** — making them dependent on central planning for every aspect of life
5. **Demanded international scope** — ensuring no organic, locally governed commune could exist independently

Every single one of these features served the same purpose: **preventing communism from emerging in any form the deep state could not control**. The Russian *mir* was communism without Marx. The early Christian communities were communism without Marx. The Peruvian *ayllu* was communism without Marx. All of them were self-governing, spiritually grounded, culturally rooted, and operationally independent of any central financial authority. That is what had to be prevented.

The version of "communism" we were given — Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism — was never communism at all. It was **state capitalism administered by a party aristocracy**, which is precisely Kinkel's Form 4 (state-collectivist) masquerading as Form 1 (communal). The deep state did not oppose communism. They opposed communism they could not control. What they imposed instead was a totalitarian simulation — wearing communism's name, carrying communism's banner, and systematically destroying everything communism actually meant.

Kinkel proved this was unnecessary. His work showed that the transition from capitalism to communal forms was a **natural, recurring, evolutionary process** that could emerge without violence, without the destruction of culture, without the abolition of religion, and without centralised party dictatorship. That is precisely why his work had to be erased — and why, to this day, almost no one has heard of him.

## The Suppression of the Alternative

Kinkel did not simply fade from view. He was actively suppressed — by every power bloc of his era and the one that outlived him.

During the interwar period, Kinkel was openly critical of fascism, Bolshevism, and the crisis of parliamentary democracy. His analyses were so politically dangerous that he was forced to publish under multiple **pen names** — "M. Mladenov" and "A. Fridyung" — to avoid direct reprisal. His critique of Werner Sombart's "German Socialism" model, published as Mladenov, was a direct attack on the intellectual foundations of National Socialism. His analysis of the global economic crisis, published as Fridyung, diagnosed the structural failures that the authoritarian regimes exploited.

Kinkel was convinced that history was moving toward a new social form — a kind of **global non-Bolshevik socialism** that differed radically from both Western capitalism and Soviet communism. This view put him at odds with every power bloc of his era:

- **The Soviets** rejected him because he denied the Marxist framework and the inevitability of violent revolution
- **The Fascists** rejected him because he exposed their pseudo-national-socialist economics as Medieval retreats
- **The Western liberals** ignored him because his model predicted the end of their capitalist phase
- **The Bulgarian communist regime** (post-1944) posthumously condemned him as an "eclectic" bourgeois thinker and destroyed his academic reputation

Kiril Grigorov, the leading communist-era historian of Bulgarian economic thought, dismissively called Kinkel's models *"kinkeliads"* (*кинкелиади*) — a term designed to brand his comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach as unserious dilettantism. The term persisted throughout the communist period and effectively quarantined Kinkel's work from serious discussion for half a century.

### The Pattern of Suppression

Kinkel's fate was not unique. It was part of a systematic pattern in which independent economic thinkers — those who proposed alternatives to both Marxist materialism and laissez-faire capitalism — were excluded from the international publication networks that Marx and his followers monopolised:

| Thinker | Contribution | Suppression |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ivan Kinkel** (1883–1945) | Three-cycle, four-form model of development; interdisciplinary method | Never translated; branded "eclectic"; suppressed by communist regime |
| **Simeon Demostenov** (1886–1966) | Austrian-school pure theory for peripheral economies | Unknown outside Bulgaria |
| **Sergei Bulgakov** (1871–1944) | Spiritual economics; critique of Marxist materialism | Exiled from Soviet Russia in 1922 |
| **Peter Struve** (1870–1944) | Kinkel's mentor; critique of Marxist economic determinism | Exiled, died in Paris in poverty |
| **Nikolai Kondratiev** (1892–1938) | Long-wave economic cycles | Arrested, sent to Gulag, executed by Stalin |

The pattern is clear: anyone who proposed a richer, more historically grounded, more spiritually and culturally aware model of economic development was silenced — whether by Marxists, fascists, or the simple institutional weight of publication networks that favoured Marxist-compatible narratives.

Had Kinkel's work been widely known — had it been translated, distributed, debated at the same scale as Marx's — the revolutionaries of 1917 might have had access to an alternative vision: one that preserved the spiritual and cultural dimensions of communal life, one that recognised the evolutionary continuity between old and new, one that did not require the incineration of every church, the execution of every priest, the destruction of every document that connected the Russian people to their Hordian past. Instead, they had *Das Kapital*. And they followed the script.

## Did Ivan Kinkel Know About Gottfried Kinkel?

There is no confirmed genealogical link between **Ivan Germanovich Kinkel** (1883–1945) and **Gottfried Kinkel** (1815–1882), the German poet-revolutionary who fought in the 1848 revolution, joined and then split from Marx's Communist League, and died in exile in Zürich. The surname "Kinkel" is uncommon, and both men operated within the German intellectual orbit — Ivan studied in Berlin (1903–1905), Leipzig (1906–1908), and Zurich (1908–1911), all cities where Gottfried's name was very much part of the revolutionary and academic memory. Whether they shared blood is an open question best answered by archival research in the Bulgarian National Archive (fund 620/1/22, Mara Kinkel's record) and German genealogical databases.

But whether or not they were related, it is almost inconceivable that Ivan did not *know about* Gottfried.

Ivan Germanovich Kinkel was born in Bryansk in 1883 — exactly one year after Gottfried died in Zürich. He received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig in 1911 with a thesis on Aristotle's theology. He studied in Berlin and Zurich. He was encyclopaedically educated, read German fluently, and worked within academic traditions that owed their existence to the generation of German thinkers that included Gottfried Kinkel's circle. The story of Gottfried's 1848 uprising, imprisonment, dramatic rescue by Carl Schurz, exile in London, split with Marx, failed fundraising tour of America, and death in Zürich was one of the most famous revolutionary narratives of the 19th century — recounted in Schurz's bestselling *Reminiscences* (1907), in every German encyclopaedia, and in the academic mythology of every university Ivan attended.

A Russian intellectual with the surname Kinkel, studying at Leipzig and Berlin in the 1900s, could not *not* have heard of Gottfried. The question is what he made of it.

### From Gottfried's Failure to Ivan's Theory

Consider the timeline from Ivan's perspective:

**1848–1850:** Gottfried Kinkel fights in the German revolution, is imprisoned, and is dramatically rescued by Carl Schurz. He joins the Communist League in London, sides with the Willich-Schapper faction against Marx, advocates immediate democratic revolutionary action. Marx savages him as a sentimental fool.

**1850–1882:** Kinkel's faction loses. Marx's version of communism — theoretical, patient, centralised, violent when the time comes — dominates the international movement through mass-distributed literature. Gottfried dies in obscure exile in Zürich. His romantic, democratic, voluntarist communism dies with him.

**1905:** The first Russian Revolution erupts. Ivan Kinkel, then age 22, **loses his right hand** in the fighting. He experiences personally what Gottfried experienced fifty-seven years earlier: the mixture of idealism, violence, failure, and state repression that defines revolutionary movements.

**1917:** The second Russian Revolution succeeds — but immediately begins devouring itself in factional violence, purges, and centralisation of power. Lenin personally invites Ivan to chair the Supreme Economic Council. Ivan declines due to health. He and his wife Mara flee Russia with a note from Lenin, crossing through the chaos of the Russian Civil War and Nestor Makhno's counter-revolutionary Ukraine. He destroys Lenin's note to survive.

**1918–1921:** In exile in Bulgaria, Ivan writes his masterwork — a 312-page theory of economic development that systematically demonstrates everything Marx got wrong. Capitalism is not a unique modern phase. The communist form recurs naturally in every civilisational cycle. Violent revolution is not necessary. The economic base does not determine the superstructure. Multiple factors — productive, consumptive, cultural, psychological, biological — drive development simultaneously.

This is not the work of a man who *agreed* with Marx and merely refined the theory. This is the work of a man who watched Marxist revolution in action, saw it devolving toward exactly the dictatorship and genocide that Marx's framework made inevitable, and went looking for a better model. A model that could explain *why* revolutions repeatedly fail, why state-collectivism keeps emerging as a recurring form rather than a utopian endpoint, and why organic communal self-governance doesn't require anyone to be shot.

Ivan almost certainly knew that Gottfried had tried the romantic approach — act now, fight for democracy, build the republic through moral courage — and that it had been crushed. Not just by Prussian rifles, but by Marx's publication machine and the international networks that made Marxism the *only* version of communism anyone heard about. Ivan's response was not to try Gottfried's approach again. It was to build something *deeper*: a theoretical framework so historically grounded, so multidisciplinary, so resistant to reductionism that it could not be easily co-opted or overridden by any single-factor ideology.

Gottfried tried to outfight Marx. Ivan tried to outthink him. Both failed — not because their ideas were wrong, but because the distribution networks belonged to the deep state.

### The Pattern

Two men named Kinkel, two generations apart, both engaged in revolutionary movements, both opposed to the Marxist model, both producing work that pointed toward organic, self-governing, culturally grounded alternatives to state-totalitarian "communism." The first was a romantic who fought and lost. The second was a theorist who analysed and was forgotten.

Between them lies the entire tragedy of communism's stolen promise: a word that once meant villages governing themselves, communities sharing resources, and people answering to nobody but their own — hijacked by a publication machine, reduced to a demolition manual, and used to build the most controlling state apparatus in human history.
