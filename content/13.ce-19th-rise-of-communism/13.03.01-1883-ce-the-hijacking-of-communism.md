# The Hijacking of Communism: Why the Deep State Had to Impose Its Own Version

## The Threat Was Never Communism — It Was *Uncontrolled* Communism

**Communism** — communal ownership, shared resources, collective self-governance — is one of the oldest forms of human economic organisation. It existed in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, pre-Columbian Peru, and the Russian *mir* and *obshchina* (village communes) of the 19th century. It recurs in every civilisational cycle because it is a **natural phase of economic development**, not an ideology invented in the British Museum Reading Room.

This is why it was dangerous — not to its participants, but to the **financial aristocracy** that controlled European economies through banking, debt, and imperial monopoly. Organic communism produces self-governing communities that owe nothing to international finance. The Pyramidal Empire needed communism to exist on **their terms**: violent, centralised, atheist, and administered by a party apparatus they could infiltrate.

That is what Marxism was for. And **Ivan Germanovich Kinkel** (1883–1945) proved — without intending to — that communism required no revolution, no vanguard party, and no destruction of existing culture.

## What Kinkel Discovered

In 1921, Kinkel published his 312-page masterwork: *"Attempt at Constructing a New Theory of Economic Development of Cultural Mankind"*. Where Marx proposed crude linear progression (primitive communism → slavery → feudalism → capitalism → communism), Kinkel demonstrated development operates on **two simultaneous levels**:

**Level 1: Three Great Cultural Cycles** — Egyptian-Babylonian-Peruvian (~5000–550 BCE), Greek-Roman (~1800 BCE–5th c. CE), and European-Slavic (Medieval onward).

**Level 2: Four Recurring Economic Forms** — (1) communist/communal, (2) petty-individual, (3) capitalist, and (4) state-collectivist.

The critical discovery: **Form 1 — the communist form — naturally recurs at the beginning of every civilisational cycle.** It is the *beginning* of each era, not the end of history. Development moves as a **spiral** — forward via technology and population, combined with recurring patterns from productive forces, consumption forces, and cultural needs.

## Why This Was Intolerable

Kinkel's model was a death sentence for the Marxist project because: communism is *natural* (Form 1 appeared without a manifesto); violent revolution was a *feature* designed to destroy institutions and knowledge; Marx's economics was deliberately reductive (Kinkel called single-factor explanation a *"universal phlogiston"*); and capitalism was merely Form 3, recurring in every civilisation — the transition away from it didn't require apocalyptic violence.

Kinkel proposed the **biogenetic law of social development**: newer civilisations recapitulate older economic forms before advancing, driven by accumulation and acceleration — resembling modern fractal theory. This is the opposite of dialectical materialism.

## The Pattern: Co-opt, Corrupt, Control

Earlier communal thinkers (More, Campanella, Saint-Simon, Fourier) imagined societies preserving spiritual life. Marx stripped out everything human and replaced it with a mechanistic programme requiring violent revolution, elimination of religion, and centralised party authority — every feature designed to prevent communism from emerging in any form the Pyramidal Empire couldn't control. What we were given — Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism — was **state capitalism administered by a party aristocracy**: Form 4 masquerading as Form 1. See [The Battle for Communism's Soul](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.03.00-1848-ce-the-battle-for-communisms-soul.md).

## The Suppression

Kinkel published under pen names **M. Mladenov** and **A. Fridyung** to avoid reprisal. Communist-era historian Kiril Grigorov branded his models *"kinkeliadi"* — quarantining his work for half a century. He was rejected by every power bloc: Soviets (denied Marx), Fascists (exposed pseudo-economics), Western liberals (predicted capitalism's end), and Bulgaria's communist regime (posthumously condemned as "eclectic").

His fate was part of a systematic pattern — independent economic thinkers silenced across all ideologies: **Simeon Demostenov** (unknown outside Bulgaria), **Sergei Bulgakov** (exiled 1922), **Peter Struve** (exiled, died in poverty), **Nikolai Kondratiev** (executed by Stalin).

Had Kinkel's work been translated and debated at Marx's scale, the 1917 revolutionaries might have had an alternative: one preserving spiritual and cultural life, recognising evolutionary continuity, not requiring the destruction of every church or document connecting Russia to its Hordian past. Instead, they had *Das Kapital*.

## Did Ivan Know Gottfried?

No confirmed genealogical link exists between Ivan Kinkel and [Gottfried Kinkel](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.03.00-1848-ce-the-battle-for-communisms-soul.md) (1815–1882). But Ivan studied in Berlin, Leipzig, and Zurich — cities where Gottfried's revolutionary legend was academic mythology. Both failed, not because their ideas were wrong, but because the distribution networks belonged to the Pyramidal Empire.
