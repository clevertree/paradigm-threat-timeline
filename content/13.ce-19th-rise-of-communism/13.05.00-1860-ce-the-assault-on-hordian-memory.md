# The 19th Century Assault on Hordian Memory

## The Obshchina: Living Memory of Hordian Communalism

The Russian village commune (*obshchina*) — with its collective land ownership, periodic redistribution of strips, and communal decision-making through the *mir* (village assembly) — was the last living institutional memory of how the Hordian world-empire had actually organised its economy. These were not "primitive" social structures, as Marxist historians insisted. They were the degraded but still functional remnants of the administrative system described in the New Chronology: an empire governed through Cossack-military communes with collective land tenure, shared resources, and hereditary obligations.

The 19th-century Russian intelligentsia was obsessed with the *obshchina* question. The Slavophiles saw it as proof of Russia's unique spiritual destiny. The Westernisers saw it as a backward relic. And the Marxists — following their script — dismissed it as "primitive communism" that had to be destroyed so that capitalism could fully develop before the *real* revolution could occur.

This was the genius of the Marxist demolition manual: it convinced the Russian communists to destroy the very institution that embodied *actual* communism — the living communal structures inherited from the pre-Romanov era — in the name of a theoretical communism that had never existed and could only be reached through industrial apocalypse.

## The Campaign to Rewrite Russian Economic History

Throughout the 19th century, the Romanov regime and its sponsored historians conducted a systematic campaign to rewrite Russian economic history. The goal was to present the pre-Romanov period as a time of "Tatar yoke" and barbarism — obscuring the fact that the so-called Tatar-Mongol Empire was actually the Russian Horde itself, with its own sophisticated economic and administrative system.

Kinkel's model provides the analytical framework for understanding what was destroyed. According to his periodisation, the Hordian economic system likely represented a version of **Form 1** (communal-collectivist) at an advanced level within **Cycle III** (the West and East European era). It combined:

- Collective land tenure (the *obshchina*)
- Military-administrative governance (the Cossack hosts)
- Communal taxation and resource-sharing
- Integration of spiritual life with economic organisation

The Marxist insistence that this system was "primitive" and needed to be destroyed was not a neutral analytical judgment. It was the ideological justification for demolishing the last remnant of Hordian civilisation.

## The Narodniki and the Road Not Taken

The Russian Narodniks (*народники*) — populists of the 1860s–1880s — recognised something that Marx refused to admit: that Russia's communal institutions might offer a direct path to socialism without passing through the horrors of full capitalist industrialisation. Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Alexander Herzen, and others argued that the *obshchina* was not a relic but a *foundation* — that Russia could build a just society on its existing communal structures rather than destroying them first.

Marx himself was forced to engage with this argument in his famous 1881 letter to Vera Zasulich, where he grudgingly admitted that the Russian commune *might* serve as "the fulcrum for social regeneration in Russia" — a concession that contradicted his entire theoretical framework and was suppressed by his followers after his death.

The Narodniks were crushed. Their movement was infiltrated, discredited, and replaced by Marxist Social Democracy — which insisted, per the script, that capitalism must develop fully before revolution was possible. The Bolsheviks, who eventually carried out the revolution, followed this script with lethal precision: they destroyed the communes, collectivised agriculture by force, and murdered millions of peasants in the name of "modernisation."

## Kinkel's Framework Applied

Kinkel's theory explains what happened to Russia in the 19th century as a transition crisis within Cycle III. The old Hordian system (Form 1 at a high level of development) had been violently disrupted by the Romanov seizure and Western intervention. What followed — the 19th-century conflict between communalists and capitalists, between Slavophiles and Westernisers — was the chaotic process of an imposed transition from Form 1 through Forms 2 and 3 (petty-individual and capitalist) under external pressure.

Marx's role in this process was to provide the ideological narrative that made this violent, externally imposed transition appear *inevitable* — a natural law of history rather than a political choice made by identifiable actors for identifiable reasons.

Kinkel, by contrast, showed that transitions between forms are shaped by the *full spectrum* of human factors — productive, consumptive, cultural, psychological, biological — and that the outcome is never predetermined. The destruction of Russia's communal structures was not inevitable. It was engineered. And the ideology that justified the engineering was Marxism.
