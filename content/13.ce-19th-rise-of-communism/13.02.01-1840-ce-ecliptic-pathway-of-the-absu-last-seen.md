# Ecliptic pathway of the Absu last seen.

The [Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php) was Saturn's primordial plasma sheath — equatorial ring-layers enveloping Earth and the inner planets during the Golden Age. To ancient observers it appeared as a luminous ocean standing up from the southern horizon, described as *the Firmament*, the *Duat*, the *House of Nine Bushes*, and the *Abyss* worldwide. After the polar configuration collapsed in 2349 BC (Noah's Flood), the inner Absu fell — but an outer ring persisted.

## The Last Ring: The Uoroboros

One outer ring survived 2349 BC. Red, sitting ~6,000 miles above Earth's equator, Earth's shadow made it appear each night as a glowing snake whose head rose in the east, slid across the southern sky, and folded back on its own tail — the *Uoroboros*. The Egyptians called it *Apep*, Greeks *Apophis*, Hindus *Vritra*, Babylonians *Tiamat*, Australians the *Rainbow Serpent*. Same red equatorial ring, observed from every continent.

The ecliptic crossed this ring at the equinoxes, forming a giant "X" — the Maya *Saint Andrew's Cross* hieroglyph. By **AD 600–800** the ring had faded; by **~AD 900** it had disappeared entirely.

## Absu Dust: 4,000 Years of Falling Particles

Even after the rings dissolved, remnant material — charged micron-scale particles — continued raining down for millennia. Charles Raspil (*"Spatters and Planetary Iconography,"* The Velikovskian, 1994) documented the artistic record: characteristic *spatter* patterns (central ringlet surrounded by eight smaller ringlets) appear in artwork from the mid-second millennium BC through the **18th century AD** — Rhodian plates, Near Eastern reliefs, Egyptian papyri, Mesoamerican codices, and Renaissance paintings. These appear as background texture, not symbols — objects actually seen.

Cook interprets these as charged particles discharging briefly in arc or glow mode on approaching Earth's surface — *"igniting briefly in the blaze of plasma... as suddenly as firecrackers."* The dust rained down for nearly 4,000 years.

## Terminal Dates

Cook records two reference points for the end:

- **~AD 1600** — *"Last of the falling Absu sprinkles"* ([long.php](https://saturniancosmology.org/long.php))
- **~AD 1700** — *"Last sprinkling of Absu dust"* ([nevada.php](https://saturniancosmology.org/nevada.php))

The variation reflects gradual thinning rather than a hard stop.

## The Ecliptic Pathway: Last Seen AD 1840

One atmospheric trace outlasted even the dust. The **ecliptic pathway** — zodiacal material strewn along the orbital plane by Jupiter's plasma bolts in the asteroid belt — remained faintly visible for another century.

> *"The destruction wrought by Jupiter with plasma bolts in the asteroid belt would have left dust and debris strewn along the ecliptic, causing the 'path of the Gods' to be marked like a highway. The lighted zodiac was last seen from Earth in AD 1840."*
> — Jno Cook, [SaturnianCosmology.org](https://saturniancosmology.org/flood.php#flood-g34)

The complete terminal sequence:
- ~**AD 600–800**: Red Uoroboros ring fades
- ~**AD 900**: Uoroboros fully gone
- ~**AD 1600–1700**: Last Absu dust reaches ground
- **AD 1840**: Ecliptic zodiacal pathway last observed

## Connection to the MudFlood Event

The convergence with the late 18th-century political crisis is striking. The [Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) erupted in 1773 — within decades of the last Absu dust and the final ecliptic fading. The Absu's long dispersal had maintained a persistent electrical connection between Earth's atmosphere and remnant Saturn-system material. As this cleared, the atmospheric equilibrium of antiquity broke.

The [MudFlood Event](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md) describes a catastrophic discharge event that buried cities worldwide. The loss of the Absu charge envelope may have made Earth's atmosphere newly receptive to large-scale discharge events impossible while the protective layer persisted.
