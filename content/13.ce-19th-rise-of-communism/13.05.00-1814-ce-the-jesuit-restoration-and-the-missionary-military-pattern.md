# The Jesuit Restoration and the Missionary-Military Pattern

In 1814, Pope [Pius VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_VII) restored the Society of Jesus — reversing the [1773 suppression](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.01.00-1718-ce-secret-society-of-jesus-goes-public.md) that had disbanded them under pressure from the very monarchies they helped create. The restoration unleashed the most industrialized wave of missionary expansion in history, powered by steamships, railroads, telegraph lines, and the full backing of the 19th century colonial empires.

The Jesuits had survived forty-one years of official dissolution by sheltering under the protection of Catherine the Great of Russia — the one European monarch who refused to publish the papal brief of suppression. The irony was exquisite: the order created to help dismantle the Hordian Empire found refuge in the successor state of that empire, because the Romanov dynasty recognized the Jesuits' educational and administrative value even while the rest of Europe feared their political influence.

## The Pattern: Missionaries First, Military Second

By the 19th century, the relationship between Jesuit missions and colonial military intervention had calcified into a repeatable, almost mechanical pattern:

1. **Peaceful missionaries arrive.** Jesuits were sent to indigenous communities as the first point of contact. They learned the local language. They documented the local religion, cosmology, history, and social structure — often with genuine intellectual rigour. They built schools and hospitals. They were, by the standards of European colonial agents, remarkably respectful.

2. **Missionaries are killed.** Indigenous communities that recognized the missionaries as the vanguard of an alien civilization sometimes responded with violence. Missionaries were killed, burned alive, eaten, tortured, or expelled. The [North American Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Martyrs) — eight Jesuits killed by Iroquois between 1642 and 1649 — became the template. In South America, the Guaraní killed Jesuits who pushed conversion too aggressively. In Africa, missionaries died of disease, violence, or both. In the Pacific Islands, missionaries were consumed by communities that regarded them as invaders.

3. **The empire intervenes.** Each missionary death was publicized in Europe as evidence of indigenous "savagery" and "wickedness." The deaths of innocent men of God — and their families, when present — created the moral and political grounds for military expeditions to "rescue" surviving missionaries, "punish" the offending communities, and "secure" the region for future Christian settlement. The missionaries, who had genuinely risked their lives for what they believed was a sacred mission, became *posthumous propaganda* for military conquest they would never have endorsed.

4. **Colonial administration consolidates.** After the military intervention, colonial administrators, merchants, and settlers moved in. The mission stations became trading posts, then forts, then towns. The indigenous population was already partially converted, partially displaced, and fully documented — the Jesuits' own ethnographic records told the colonizers exactly what resources existed, what alliances could be exploited, and what resistance to expect.

This pattern was not an accident or an unintended consequence. It was the operational logic of empire. The Jesuits took the punishment for the sins of the empire, and the empire used their suffering to justify its expansion.

## The Jesuit Difference: They Wrote It All Down

It is essential to distinguish the Jesuits from the Protestant missionary and academic tradition that ran parallel to them in the 19th century. The distinction is not theological — it is *epistemic*.

**The Jesuits documented everything.** When they encountered indigenous peoples, they learned the language fluently, often becoming the only Europeans to achieve true comprehension. They recorded oral histories, cosmological systems, astronomical knowledge, medicinal practices, kinship structures, and political arrangements — not as curiosities but as *data*. The [Jesuit Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_Relations), the vast corpus of annual reports from North American missions (1632–1673), remain one of the most important primary sources for indigenous North American history. In South America, Jesuit documentation of the [Guaraní Reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_reduction) preserved records of Guaraní language, governance, and agriculture that would otherwise have been lost entirely. In Asia, the Jesuits became the primary European translators of Chinese, Japanese, and Sanskrit texts.

The Jesuits wrote down accurately everything they learned from the indigenous people — including their entire history — even when that history contradicted the Catholic narrative they were trying to impose. This intellectual honesty, embedded in an organization serving ends it didn't fully understand, is what makes the Jesuit archive one of the most valuable (and most underutilized) sources for the reconstruction of pre-colonial world history.

**The Protestants rewrote everything.** The Protestant chronological tradition — embodied by [Joseph Justus Scaliger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger) (1540–1609) and his successor [Denis Petavius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_P%C3%A9tau) (1583–1652) — took a fundamentally different approach. As documented in [Deep State erases Russian Empire from all chronology](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.04-1627-ce-deep-state-erases-russian-empire-from-all-chronology.md), the Scaligerian project was not interested in the claims of indigenous peoples, the records of the Russian Empire they were protesting, or any source that didn't serve the Protestant political agenda. They didn't document — they fabricated. They created the chronological framework that placed "Ancient" Greece and Rome thousands of years before the Common Era, manufactured phantom dynasties to fill the gaps, and ignored every contradictory source as "barbarian" or "unreliable."

The difference matters. The Jesuit archive, for all its Catholic bias, contains *actual observations* of indigenous cultures as they existed before full colonial destruction. The Scaligerian chronology contains *political constructions* designed to legitimize Protestant power and delegitimize the Catholic-Orthodox-Hordian order the Reformation was trying to destroy. It is for this specific reason that the Protestant-influenced version of human history is the most corrupt, most cynically clinical and detached, and most error-prone — because the Protestant chronologists were satisfying their own political agendas and were **not interested in math, science, physics, or truth**.

Fomenko's New Chronology, in this light, is essentially a systematic audit of the Scaligerian fabrication — using the mathematical and astronomical tools that Scaliger himself never bothered to apply rigorously.

## The Jesuit Jerusalem Project

Parallel to the 19th century missionary expansion, the Jesuits were completing their final chronological project: the permanent institutionalization of Jerusalem's location in Palestine. As documented in [Tchaikovsky releases 1812 Overture](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.02.02-1880-ce-tchaikovsky-releases-1812-overture.md), the Jesuits *deliberately marked the wrong location on the map* — marching pilgrims past the actual ruins in Turkey (the original Constantinople/Czar-Grad location of Biblical Jerusalem) and establishing Jerusalem III at [Al-Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) / Al-Quds in Palestine.

This purposeful redaction of Jerusalem's location became a *Jesuit test of faith*: to be a Christian, Muslim, or Jew, one must believe that the Palestinian location was always the original. The three Abrahamic faiths are thus anchored to a geography that was chosen in the 17th–19th centuries — with all the political consequences for the Middle East that this implies.

## 19th Century Missionary Martyrdoms: Selected Cases

| Date | Location | Event | Consequence |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1816 | Hawaii | First Protestant missionaries arrive; initial resistance from native Hawaiians | American commercial and military presence grows through the century |
| 1835 | Madagascar | Queen [Ranavalona I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranavalona_I) expels all missionaries and bans Christianity | Framed in Europe as "fanaticism"; French invasion of 1883 followed |
| 1838 | New Zealand | Missionaries establish presence; [Wairau Affray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wairau_Affray) (1843) | Treaty of Waitangi and progressive British colonial control |
| 1860 | China | [Tianjin Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_Massacre) — French Catholic missionary nuns and priests killed | France and Britain demanded reparations, further unequal treaties |
| 1870 | Japan | Post-[Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration) Christian missions resume after two-century ban | Western commercial penetration through "opening" of Japan |
| 1885 | Congo | Catholic missionaries arrive alongside [Leopold II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium)'s colonial operation | Missionaries documented atrocities but also enabled the system |
| 1893 | Korea | Catholic and Protestant missionaries establish presence | Laid groundwork for Western geopolitical involvement through 20th century |
| 1900 | China | [Boxer Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion) — 30,000 Chinese Christians and hundreds of missionaries killed | Eight-nation alliance military intervention; massive indemnities imposed |

The Boxer Rebellion of 1900 represents the culmination of the missionary-military pattern in its purest form: indigenous resistance to Christian infiltration was met with the concerted military force of eight Western powers, resulting in foreign occupation and punitive treaties that accelerated China's colonial subjugation.
