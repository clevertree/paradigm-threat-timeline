# The Jesuit Restoration and the Missionary-Military Pattern

In 1814, Pope [Pius VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_VII) restored the Society of Jesus — reversing the [1773 suppression](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.01.00-1718-ce-secret-society-of-jesus-goes-public.md). The Jesuits had survived forty-one years under Catherine the Great's protection — the one European monarch who refused to publish the papal brief.

## The Missionary-Military Pattern

By the 19th century, the relationship between missions and military intervention had calcified into a repeatable cycle:

1. **Peaceful missionaries arrive** — learn the language, document religion, social structure, and resources with genuine rigour. Build schools and hospitals.
2. **Missionaries are killed** — communities that recognised the existential threat responded with violence. Deaths were publicised in Europe as evidence of "savagery."
3. **The empire intervenes** — each mission death created moral grounds for military expeditions to "rescue" missionaries and "secure" the region.
4. **Colonial administration consolidates** — mission stations became trading posts, then forts, then towns. The Jesuits' own ethnographic records told colonisers what resources existed and what resistance to expect.

The Jesuits always took the punishment for the sins of the empire. And the empire always used their suffering to justify expansion.

## The Jesuit Difference: They Wrote It All Down

The Jesuits documented everything — languages, oral histories, cosmological systems, astronomical knowledge, medicinal practices. The [Jesuit Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_Relations) (1632–1673) remain essential for indigenous North American history. In South America and Asia, they became the primary translators of indigenous and classical texts. They wrote down accurately what they learned *even when it contradicted the Catholic narrative they were imposing*.

**The Protestants rewrote everything.** The Scaligerian project fabricated the chronological framework placing "Ancient" Greece and Rome thousands of years before the Common Era, manufactured phantom dynasties, and ignored contradictory sources. The distinction matters: the Jesuit archive contains *actual observations*, while the Scaligerian chronology contains *political constructions*. See [Deep State erases chronology](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.01.04-1627-ce-deep-state-erases-russian-empire-from-all-chronology.md).

## 19th Century Martyrdoms: The Pattern Industrialised

| Date | Location | Event | Consequence |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1835 | Madagascar | Queen Ranavalona I expels missionaries | French invasion 1883 |
| 1860 | China | Tianjin Massacre — missionaries killed | Unequal treaties imposed |
| 1885 | Congo | Missionaries arrive with Leopold II | Documented atrocities but enabled the system |
| 1900 | China | Boxer Rebellion — 30,000 Christians, hundreds of missionaries killed | Eight-nation alliance military intervention |

The Boxer Rebellion was the culmination: indigenous resistance to Christian infiltration met with eight Western powers' concerted force, resulting in occupation and punitive treaties.
