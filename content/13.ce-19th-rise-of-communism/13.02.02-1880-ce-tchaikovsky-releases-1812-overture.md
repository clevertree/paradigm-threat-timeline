# Tchaikovsky releases 1812 Overture

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed the [1812 Overture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_Overture) in 1880, commissioned for the consecration of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. Its premiere featured live cannon fire, church bells, and massed military bands.

The overture opens with **the Russian Orthodox hymn** *God Preserve Thy People*, drawn from the ancient Kievan liturgical tradition — the music of the old Hordian spiritual world. This is pitted against the *Marseillaise* (the French Revolutionary anthem) and overwhelmed by cannon blasts and church bells. The thematic contest is between two visions of civilisation: the old Orthodox-Imperial order and the new Financial-Republican order that Napoleon carried across Europe.

## Financial Sovereignty: The Real War

The decades preceding Napoleon's invasion were defined by a single contest: who would control the post-Hordian financial architecture — the City of London's debt-based system, or any remaining state sovereignty?

In the United States, [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton) and the Federalists chose alignment with London — assuming debts, passing tax laws, and creating a central bank linked with England. [Masonic networks](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.01-the-masons.md) permeated the founding generation. Anti-Federalists like Thomas Jefferson favoured France and feared central authority.

France charted a different course. In 1790, the Revolutionary government banned usury and cancelled Church taxes. Financial independence made France the immediate target of every London-financed coalition.

## Napoleon's Rise and Fall

Napoleon rose through the military crisis that financial independence caused: the First Coalition (1792–97), victory at Toulon (1793), the [Egyptian campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria) (1798–1801) — which brought French scholars into direct contact with Hordian ruins that mainstream archaeology would later date to "antiquity" — the [Coup of 18 Brumaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_Brumaire) (1799), and Emperor by 1804.

Napoleon legally emancipated France's Jewish population and abolished the Inquisition across his domains (Venice 1797, formally dissolved 1806). In the NC framework, this represented the final unravelling of the institutional apparatus the Reformation had used to control the remnants of the old Imperial treasury caste.

His defeat came from the same coalition that had carved up Moscow Tartary: the Romanov dynasty and the British financial empire, subsidised by Rothschild credit networks. The scorched-earth campaign of 1812 ensured Napoleon found only ash. The [Congress of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna) (1815) restored European monarchies — but every throne was now indebted to the banking houses that had financed the wars. Political sovereignty was restored; financial sovereignty was not.

## The Jesuit Jerusalem Project

Parallel to the Napoleonic wars, the Jesuits completed their chronological project: marching pilgrims past the actual ruins in Turkey (Constantinople/Czar-Grad = Biblical Jerusalem) and founding Jerusalem III at [Al-Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) in Palestine. This purposeful redaction became a *Jesuit test of faith*: to be a Christian, Muslim, or Jew, one must believe the Palestinian location was always the original. See [The Jesuit Restoration](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.05.00-1814-ce-the-jesuit-restoration-and-the-missionary-military-pattern.md) for the full pattern.

## Tchaikovsky's Musical Testament

Tchaikovsky composed the overture sixty-eight years after the event. By 1880, the old Hordian world was visible only in the Orthodox Church's liturgical music — the same music that opens his overture. The cannon fire that ends it represents both the Russian victory of 1812 and the gunpowder used to blow up Cathar castles, demolish Hordian fortifications, and end every state that refused the new financial order. In the NC reading, the 1812 Overture is the last great piece of *counter-historical* art: a musical argument that the old world was worth fighting for. By the time Tchaikovsky wrote it, that argument had already been lost.
