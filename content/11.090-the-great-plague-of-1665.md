# The Great Plague of 1665

> It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles - in -the - Field. It started slowly at first but by May of

> London at that time was a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a city wall that had originally
> been built to keep out raiding bands, and, in the south, by the River Thames. There were gates in the wall at Ludgate,
> Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate, and the Thames was crossable at London

> In the poorer parts of the city, filled with overcrowded tenements and garrets, hygiene was impossible to maintain.
> There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with
  > animal droppings, rubbish and the slops thrown out of the houses; they were muddy and buzzing with flies in summer,
  > and awash with sewage in winter. The City Corporation employed "rakers" to remove the worst of the filth, and it was
> transported to mounds outside the walls, where it accumulated and continued to decompose. The stench was overwhelming,
> and people walked around with handkerchiefs or nosegays pressed against their nostrils. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys/1665/March#March_1st

## The Plague as Strategic Disruption

The Great Plague of London (1665) killed an estimated 100,000 people — roughly 15% of the city's population. Its timing, arriving immediately before the Great Fire of 1666, created a two-year period of maximum destabilization for the existing London power structure. The old guild-based City of London, dominated by goldsmiths and independent merchants who had survived the Civil War as a rival power center to the Crown, found its population decimated and its institutional memory disrupted just as the financial reforms of the 1670s were being planned.

The 17th century European plague cycle — which struck Amsterdam, London, and other commercial centers in waves — corresponded precisely with the period of maximum Reformation disruption. The NC framework notes that epidemic disease consistently accompanied the major political transitions of the post-Hordian period: wherever an old institutional order needed to be cleared, plague arrived to do the clearing. The historical record of *who* died and *which* institutions survived each plague wave has never been fully reconstructed by mainstream historians.

## London's Physical Geography as a Weapon

The quote above from the Pepys archives reveals a critical fact about London's vulnerability: the medieval city was built inside a wall designed for military raiders, not public health crises. With open sewage channels, no sanitation system, overcrowded tenements, and a Thames-bounded geography that concentrated population density, the City of London was structurally predisposed to catastrophic epidemics. Whether this was exploited deliberately or simply opportunistically is an open question — but it is notable that the same geography that made the plague possible also made the Great Fire of 1666 possible, and both events cleared the path for the financial restructuring of 1672–1694.
