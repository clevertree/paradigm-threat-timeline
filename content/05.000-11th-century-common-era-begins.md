# 11th Century C.E. Common Era Begins

With an end to the *age of cataclysm*, the Earth bloomed with life. Plants and animals multiplied in abundance.
Predictable seasons and weather patterns prompted trade routes to be established between cities. The red rings of the
Absu begin to fade revealing a clear sky. The old Gods have departed to become planetary specks in the night sky,
replaced by the *new Saviour*, our Sun.
The *[rainbow](https://www.forthowardcc.com/blog/post/the-rainbow-covenant-)*
would become a common phenomenon signifying the promise of *no more creation*:

> “I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a
> flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
> -<cite>[ Genesis 9:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209%3A8-17&version=NIV)</cite>

    The [Phantom Time Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_conspiracy_theory)
    by Heribert Illig was published in 1991 and asserted that the Anno Domini dating system was fabricated by Jesuits
    retroactively adding in a ‘phantom’ millennium of a thousand years to the timeline starting in the special year of
    *AD1053*. Both Catholics like St Jerome and Protestants like Joseph Scaliger are accused of opportunistically
    reappropriating actual African, Asian, and American history into a false European history sometime within the last
    500 years.
