# First Crusade begins as Revenge for the Crucifixion

The *plan* works as intended as the humiliation of the crucifixion triggered a violent reaction especially in the
gathering Rus-Horde. Within 11 years, the Russians launched the First Crusade to capture the ‘Holy Sepulcher’ and take
revenge upon the crucifiers of Christ.

Not all Giants agreed with the Revenge Crusade. The older, wiser giants knew it was an obvious trap, and that two wrongs
*did not make a right*. However, the younger giants (up to 40 years old) were rash and began marching as soon as they
had the numbers. This first wave (remembered as
the [Children’s Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade) in the 13th century) fell for the trap and
were killed or sold into slavery. After this failure, the older giants got involved and drew more cautious plans to take
the holy Sepulcher and end the war.

The *Revenge Crusade* eventually turned religious as a new religion was forming around Christ and his mother Mary
(Katya). On the Trojan side, the ancient Deep State Bacchic goddess Aphrodite was worshiped. For this reason it is
remembered that the Trojan War was triggered over a woman. A decade of fighting ensues which sees the death of many
giants. The [Iliad](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/17439/what-does-branch-of-ares-mean-in-book-ii-of-the-iliad)
traces the lineage of some giants back to planet Mars where the [Jötunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn)
originated.
