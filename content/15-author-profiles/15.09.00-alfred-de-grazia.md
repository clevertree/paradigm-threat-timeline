**American** | **Political science, catastrophism, quantavolution**

De Grazia coined "quantavolution" to describe sudden, catastrophic change as the driver of geological and human history — as opposed to uniformitarian gradualism. A close associate of Velikovsky and the principal systematizer of the catastrophist intellectual project, he produced the 15-volume *Quantavolution & Catastrophe* series covering cosmology, Earth science, myth, psychology, and history from a unified catastrophist perspective. He co-authored *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966) with Juergens and Stecchini, the foundational documentation of Velikovsky's institutional suppression. His *Cosmic Heretics* (1984) is the insider memoir of the catastrophist movement. Cook credits his *Iron Age of Mars* as the "most noteworthy resource" for that era.

**Key Works:** *Quantavolution & Catastrophe* series (15 vols); *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966); *Cosmic Heretics* (1984)
