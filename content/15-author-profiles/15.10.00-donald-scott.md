**American** | **Electrical engineering, plasma astrophysics**

Scott is a retired professor of electrical engineering who applied engineering principles directly to astrophysical phenomena, producing the engineering-grade formalization of the Electric Universe plasma model. He formalized the three modes of plasma discharge (dark, glow, arc), built Juergens's electric sun into rigorous engineering analysis with calculated current flows and voltage potentials, and argued that galaxies are organized along Birkeland current filaments. Cook lists him alongside Thornhill as essential for understanding the plasma physics of the polar configuration.
