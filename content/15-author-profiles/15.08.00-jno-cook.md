**American** | **Independent research, catastrophist chronology, Mesoamerican calendrics**

Cook authored the most detailed chronological reconstruction of Saturnian events with specific calendar dates, published at saturniancosmology.org. His unique contribution is cross-cultural calendar triangulation — applying Mesoamerican Long Count data, Chinese annals, and Mesopotamian king lists simultaneously against the mythological sequence to produce specific year assignments. This timeline's Golden Age and Dark Ages event dates come primarily from Cook: 4077 BCE (start of polar configuration), 3147 BCE (end of the Golden Age), and 685 BCE (orbital stabilization, from Rose & Vaughan). The site is not original independent research but a synthesis of the entire catastrophist tradition, continuously revised since 2001.
