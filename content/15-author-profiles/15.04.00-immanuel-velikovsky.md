## Primary Contribution

Catastrophist reconstruction of ancient history through comparative mythology and ancient texts. Velikovsky argued that Venus was ejected from Jupiter as a comet within human memory, made multiple near-passes to Earth causing the plagues of Exodus and the standing still of the sun for Joshua, and eventually settled into its present orbit. His 1952 *Ages in Chaos* proposed that Egyptian chronology was mismatched with biblical history by approximately 500 years.

## Central Claims

- **Venus was a comet** within the last 3,500 years, not a primordial planet
- **Planetary catastrophism happened during recorded history**, not geological deep time
- **Ancient myths are literal eyewitness records** of celestial events
- **Egyptian chronology is inflated by ~500 years**, creating a false synchronization gap with Hebrew history

## The Suppression

Velikovsky's work was suppressed with organized ferocity. In 1950, an academic boycott of his publisher Macmillan was organized, forcing *Worlds in Collision* to be transferred to Doubleday. Carl Sagan led a late-career campaign against Velikovsky at the 1974 AAAS conference, which critics have characterized as a political trial rather than scientific inquiry.

> *"Fomenko notes that Velikovsky was essentially a defender of the Scaligerian version of modern history, only shifting ancient history. He is considered a founder of the 'critical school' in chronology, but his more conservative revisions may have inhibited the development of deeper New Chronology work in the West."*

## Relationship to This Timeline's Framework

Velikovsky was a pioneer but not the final word. His Venus comet claim, the catastrophic reordering of planetary orbits, and his insistence on interpreting ancient texts literally all feed directly into the framework here. However, his insistence on preserving Scaligerian framework chronology (only shifting Egypt) was a limitation. The Saturnian Cosmology framework (Talbott, Cook, Thornhill) extends his catastrophism into deeper pre-history.

The Sagan rebuttal was addressed definitively by Charles Ginenthal. Alfred de Grazia documented the suppression in *The Velikovsky Affair* (1966) and *Cosmic Heretics* (1984).
