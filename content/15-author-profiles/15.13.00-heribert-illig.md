## Primary Contribution

The Phantom Time Hypothesis — 297 fabricated years inserted into the early medieval calendar, creating the period 614–911 CE from nothing. Illig's 1991 book *Das erfundene Mittelalter* proposed that Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII collaborated around the symbolic year 1000 CE to insert their reign at the millennium by inventing "Charlemagne" and three centuries of history.

## Core Claims

- **No archaeological, astronomical, or architectural evidence** survives that unambiguously dates to 614–911 CE
- **Carolingian architecture**, including structures attributed to Charlemagne, shows stylistic inconsistencies with its claimed period
- **The Julian calendar** accumulated a 13-day error by 1582 that should correspond to 1,200+ years of uncorrected drift, but only ~1,000 years had elapsed — the ~200–300 year gap matches the phantom period
- **Charlemagne** may be a largely constructed figure inserted into the phantom era

## Relationship to Fomenko

Illig's work overlaps with Fomenko's New Chronology at the broad structural level — both identify a fabricated early medieval gap — but reaches the conclusion through different methods. Fomenko identifies the mechanism as script/chronicle copying errors over a longer correction period; Illig argues for deliberate political forgery in the 10th century. The two frameworks are broadly compatible though not identical.
