Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov (1854–1946) was a Russian revolutionary, scientist, and polymath who pioneered the astronomical analysis of biblical and historical texts, making him the foundational precursor to Fomenko's New Chronology. Imprisoned for decades in the Shlisselburg Fortress, he used the time to produce his most significant scholarship. His 1907 *Revelation in Storm and Thunder* reinterpreted the Book of Revelation as a symbolic record of a specific astronomical event on September 30, 395 AD — not prophecy. His seven-volume *Khristos* (1924–1932) applied astronomical, physical, and mathematical methods to overhaul traditional historical chronology, arguing that much of ancient history was fabricated and that many ancient events actually occurred in the Middle Ages. He also physically examined Codex Sinaiticus, noting its suspiciously excellent preservation for a supposedly 4th-century manuscript.

**Key Works:** *The Revelation in Storm and Thunder* (1907); *Prophets* (1914); *Khristos* (7 vols, 1924–1932)
