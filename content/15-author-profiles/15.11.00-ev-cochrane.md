**American** | **Independent scholarship, comparative mythology**

Cochrane is editor of the journal *AEON* and the leading systematic analyst of Mars and Venus mythology as catastrophist record. He documented the cross-cultural universal depiction of Venus as a multi-armed, star-like warrior goddess (*Inanna*, *Ishtar*, *Athena*, *Quetzalcoatl*) consistent with a plasma-discharge column at close approach, and argued that Mars myths (the warrior god, the dragon-slayer) recorded real near-Earth passes within the polar configuration. His methodology holds that if the same "impossible" celestial figure appears independently in 30+ cultures, it was observed — not imagined. His work corroborates Velikovsky's Venus comet claim with mythological evidence Velikovsky himself never assembled.

**Key Works:** *The Many Faces of Venus* (1997); *Martian Metamorphoses* (1997); *Stairway to Heaven* (1999)
