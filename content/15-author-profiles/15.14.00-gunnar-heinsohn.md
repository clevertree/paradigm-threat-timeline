## Primary Contribution

Stratigraphic chronology — archaeological strata do not support the conventional ancient timeline. Heinsohn argued from archaeological stratigraphy that the standard ancient timeline is chronologically inflated — the same physical strata are assigned to multiple eras (Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, early medieval) that are actually contemporaneous or sequential within a much shorter span.

## Specific Revisions

- **The 1st millennium BCE "ghost empires"** — Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Achaemenid Persian empires do not occupy distinct stratigraphic layers; they are phantom reconstructions of the same stratum
- **Roman and early medieval are the same period** — "Late Roman" and the "Migration Period" are not centuries apart but are the same catastrophic event seen from different editorial perspectives
- **The 10th century CE catastrophe** — Heinsohn identified a global stratigraphic discontinuity around 930–940 CE corresponding to a major cosmic event that ended the Roman world and reset human settlement patterns across Eurasia
- His work directly challenges the 3,000-year span of "ancient history" and supports a compressed medieval-only timeline consistent with Fomenko

## Does Both

Heinsohn both **challenges chronology** (stratigraphic evidence that ancient layers don't exist as claimed) and **interprets the physical record as world cataclysm** (the 10th century gap as evidence of a catastrophic physical event). He appears in both background articles:

- → [Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm](./content/00.overview/00.01.02-authors-cataclysm-texts.md)
