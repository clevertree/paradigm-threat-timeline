**Australian** | **Physics, plasma cosmology**

Wallace "Wal" Thornhill (1942–2023) was the principal theorist of the Electric Universe model and co-founder of the Thunderbolts Project with David Talbott. Inspired by Velikovsky's *Worlds in Collision* as a teenager, he spent five decades building an alternative cosmology grounded in plasma physics and classical electromagnetism. His core framework holds that electricity and plasma — not gravity alone — govern stars, planets, comets, and large-scale cosmic structure. He proposed the electric sun (externally powered by galactic currents, confirmed in his view by the SAFIRE experiment), electric gravity (an emergent electromagnetic phenomenon), and electric comets (rocky bodies discharging in the solar wind). His most historically significant contribution is the Saturn-Earth connection model: Saturn as a former brown dwarf that once served as Earth's host star, with the polar configuration breakup producing the catastrophes recorded in world mythology. This model is the primary scientific framework underlying this timeline's earliest chapters.

**Key Works:** *Thunderbolts of the Gods* (2005, with Talbott); *The Electric Universe* (2007, with Talbott)
