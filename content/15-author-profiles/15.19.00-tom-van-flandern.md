## Primary Contribution

The Exploded Planet Hypothesis — the asteroid belt and comets originate from a planet that exploded within the solar system within the last 65 million years, and Mars is a former moon of that exploded planet.

Van Flandern was an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory. His work on the asteroid belt and short-period comets provides the physical-astronomical framework for understanding why Mars is anomalous — a necessary underpinning for the Saturnian model's treatment of Mars as a "hollow former planet" that participated in the polar configuration.

## Claims

- **Asteroid belt composition** — the asteroids have too many distinct mineralogical types for a single-source coalescence model; they are consistent with the exploded core, mantle, and crust of a differentiated planet
- **Short-period comets** — cannot have survived 4.5 billion years in the Oort Cloud; they originate from the same explosion event and are far younger than the solar system
- **Mars is a former moon** of the exploded planet, captured by the Sun after the explosion — explaining Mars's asymmetric cratering, its outsized satellites Phobos and Deimos (rapid orbital decay inconsistent with captured objects), and its trace atmosphere
- **The K-Pg boundary** — the extinction event attributed to Chicxulub impactor may be leading-edge debris from the planetary explosion
