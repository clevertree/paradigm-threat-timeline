# Graham Hancock (b. 1950)

**Nationality:** British  
**Fields:** Investigative journalism, prehistoric archaeology, alternative history

## Primary Contribution

Evidence for a lost advanced civilization destroyed by the Younger Dryas impact event (~10,900 BCE), whose survivors seeded the apparently "sudden" emergence of agriculture and monumental architecture worldwide.

## Contributions

- **Göbekli Tepe and precursor civilizations** — the construction of Göbekli Tepe (~9600 BCE) requires a civilizational substrate that conventional prehistory cannot account for. The sophistication of the stonework and astronomical alignments implies centuries of prior development, which was wiped out by the Younger Dryas event
- **The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis** — the sudden onset of the Younger Dryas cold period (~10,900 BCE) was caused by a fragmenting comet (the Taurid Complex per Clube & Napier), producing global fires, the extinction of megafauna, and the destruction of coastal civilizations
- **Fingerprints of the Gods methodology** — astronomical alignments, precessional cycles, and monument orientations encode knowledge of a pre-catastrophe civilization whose science is preserved in stone
- **Underwater archaeology** — documented submerged structures off India, Japan, and the Mediterranean dated before the post-glacial sea-level rise (~12,000–8,000 BCE), inconsistent with the conventional prehistory timeline
- **Plato's Atlantis** — argued that Plato's account preserves genuine historical memory of a civilization destroyed at ~9,600 BCE during the Younger Dryas onset

## Does Both

Hancock **challenges the timeline** (argues human civilization is 10,000+ years older than accepted) and **interprets ancient sources as literal records** (Plato's Atlantis, global flood myths, ancient astronomer traditions). He appears in both categories:

- → [Authors Challenging the Mainstream Timeline](./content/00.overview/00.01.01-authors-challenging-chronology.md)
- → [Authors Who Read Ancient Sources as World Cataclysm](./content/00.overview/00.01.02-authors-cataclysm-texts.md)
