# The Interplanetary Quantum Entanglement

During the Golden Age, there was an over-abundance of high-amplitude, low-voltage energy flowing through each planet in
the configuration which Norse refers to as "The Bifröst". As the planets in this configuration did not spin, each North
and South Pole acted as a strong [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) between
planets. Building pyramidal structures upon these locations enabled humans to **travel instantaneously** through the
Bifröst. This may sound _outlandish_, however Egyptian mythology has a symbol for
the ["Boat of Ra"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_barque),
which [transported Ra between each planet](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)
,
and it looks **a lot** like a modern day depiction of a "wormhole":

## The Plasma Column as Trans-Planetary Bridge

The Saturnian Cosmology model identifies a physical mechanism underlying these myths: a sustained **plasma stream** in
_arc mode_ connecting Saturn's polar axis to Earth's north magnetic pole. This was not metaphor — it was a visible,
luminous, electrically-active column spanning the sky. Different cultures recorded it under different names, all
describing the same phenomenon from different latitudes and angles.

### Bifröst — The Norse Bridge Between Worlds

The Norse _Eddas_ are among the most explicit sources. From Chapter 13 of the
_[Saturnian Cosmology](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php.html)_ research work:

> _"The Eddas describe the plasma stream as the bridge Bifrost between Earth (Midgard) and the 'Other World' (Asgard).
> North of the plasma contact point in the Atlantic, the stream would have looked like an arch spanning the heavens
> from a location in the southwest to Saturn seen almost directly overhead."_

This arch of glowing plasma — visible in the northern sky, connecting the horizon to the polar star (Saturn) overhead
— was literally traversable in the sense that its electromagnetic field envelope connected the planetary bodies. Norse
legends also describe the same stream as an **"inverted tree" with roots at the top and branching near the Earth** —
exactly what a plasma column breaking into separate streamers on contact with the atmosphere would look like. This is
also the mythological **World Tree** (_Yggdrasil_) and the **Axis Mundi** of dozens of cultures worldwide.

### The Rainbow — A Misidentified Plasma Plume

The canonical mythology of the **rainbow as a divine covenant** (Genesis / Noah, Babylonian _Enuma Elish_) is
a mistranslation of the visual record. Per
_[Chapter 16: The World Flood](https://saturniancosmology.org/flood.php.html)_:

> _"In the Babylonian Enuma Elish, Marduk (Jupiter) plants his war bow in the sky to commemorate the flood ...
> This vertical 'bow' is today confused with the horizontal 'rainbow.'"_

The vertical bow was the **south polar plasma plume** — a standing luminous column, not a horizontal arc of refracted
sunlight. After the battle with Tiamat (Venus in 2349 BC), Marduk sets *"his bow, the rainbow"* (quoted from the
_Enuma Elish_) up in the heavens. The text of _[Chapter 21: Day of the Dead](https://saturniancosmology.org/jup.php.html)_
makes the identification explicit:

> _"After the battle with Tiamat, Marduk sets his bow (classically identified as 'a rainbow') up in the heavens as
> a sign of triumph. The bow is the south polar plasma plume."_

The sign given to Noah after the Flood was likely the same phenomenon — the reappearance of the polar plasma plumes
after a major orbital disruption — not a refracted light spectrum.

### Rainbow Serpent — Polar Plume as Arch Across the Sky

The **Australian Aboriginal Rainbow Serpent** (Bunyip-monster / _Ngalyod_ / _Yurlunggur_) and the
**North American Great Horned Serpent** are identified in the Saturnian model with the **north polar plasma plume**,
which appeared each time the Earth's orbit shifted:

> _"I find 'Rainbow Serpent' quite revealing, not because of the implied coloration, but for the form of an arch
> across the sky. This would seem to be Apep of the Egyptians... The Great Horned Serpent is distinct... It is
> probably the north polar plasma plume which appeared each time the orbit of the Earth increased, complete with
> horns."_
>
> — _[Chapter 20: The Flood of Noah](https://saturniancosmology.org/noah.php.html)_, Saturnian Cosmology

The **serpent-form** of the plume (a luminous plasma arch resembling a coiling serpent spanning the sky), combined
with its spectrum of auroral colours, produced the universal "rainbow serpent" archetype across cultures that had
no contact with one another.

### Boat of Ra / Ship of Heaven — Saturn's Plasma Crescent

![Egyptian Worm-Hole as depicted in egyptian mythology](/media/02.the-golden-age/wormhole.jpg)

The Egyptian **Boat of Ra** (_Solar Barque_) is one of the most anatomically precise records of the plasma
configuration. David Talbott, in _"The Ship of Heaven"_ (_Aeon Magazine_), identifies it as the visual appearance
of a **crescent of plasma light revolving around Saturn** — not the Sun:

> _"The sky once looked much different... The dominant figure in the night sky was the planet Saturn. As this and
> other planets moved closer to Earth, a reflection from the light of Saturn created the appearance of a crescent
> of light revolving around him. This... became interpreted by the ancients as 'the Ship of Heaven', and this was
> the real Boat of Ra."_
>
> — quoted in _[dragonkeypress.txt](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/flood/dragonkeypress.txt)_, Saturnian Cosmology archive

Critically, Egyptian descriptions of the Boat of Ra have it **sailing through the sky at night and journeying
through the underworld during the day** — the exact opposite of Sol behaviour — confirming it was Saturn, not the
Sun, that the Egyptians were tracking. The dead were believed to travel the Boat of Ra to reach Osiris in the
underworld: the polar plasma bridge as a literal passage for consciousness (or physical travel) between worlds.

### Eye of Ra — The Visual Signature of the Arc

The **Eye of Ra** (_Wedjat_) is described in _[Chapter 13: The Creation](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php.html)_
as a direct visual record of the polar alignment seen from Earth: Saturn as the eyeball, **Mercury as the iris**,
**Mars as the pupil**, with the rings of Saturn forming the almond-shaped lids — and a "feather-like swirl" of
plasma extending downward toward Earth as the Eye's distinctive lower tail:

> _"The swirl and ball of the 'Eye of Ra' clearly represents Venus, expelled from Saturn at the moment of creation,
> and still connected with a plume-like swirling plasma stream."_

The **uraeus** (cobra) on the pharaoh's crown is the same polar plume symbol — the plasma stream from Saturn's pole
descending to Earth's north pole, worn as a mark of connection to the heavenly axis. The Eye of Ra "arc" is thus
literally a depiction of **plasma in arc mode** connecting Saturn to Earth: the "Arc of Ra."
