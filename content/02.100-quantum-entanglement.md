# Quantum Entanglement

During the Golden Age, there was an over-abundance of high-amplitude, low-voltage energy flowing through each planet in
the configuration which Norse refers to as "The Bifröst". As the planets in this configuration did not spin, each North
and South Pole acted as a strong [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) between
planets. Building pyramidal structures upon these locations enabled humans to **travel instantaneously** through the
Bifröst. This may sound _outlandish_, however Egyptian mythology has a symbol for
the ["Boat of Ra"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_barque),
which [transported Ra between each planet](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)
,
and it looks **a lot** like a modern day depiction of a "wormhole":
