Largely influenced by the ideas of Alexander Hamilton, the Federalists succeeded in convincing the Washington
administration to assume national and state debts, pass tax laws, and create a central bank linked with England. In

were the Jesuits who [sent pilgrims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_pilgrimage) to find the ruins of Jerusalem

original location of the Biblical Jerusalem.
