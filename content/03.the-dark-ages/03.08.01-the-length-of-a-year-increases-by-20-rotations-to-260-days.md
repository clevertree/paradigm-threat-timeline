# The length of a year increases by 20 rotations to 260 days.

The cataclysmic contact with Venus ended as "_Messiah_" Jupiter re-appeared through the fading Absu. Jupiter, apparently
risen from the dead after 2.5 days, once again appeared upon its coma-tail mountain (or throne). This "resurrection"
seemed to have the effect of calming the destructive rage of Venus, and She returned to spherical form. Earth's orbit
around Jupiter changed slightly resulting in a _260-day year_ and Earth managed to **capture The Moon**, which became
visible for the first time. With the Absu significantly reduced, stars were also visible in the southern hemisphere for
the first time.
