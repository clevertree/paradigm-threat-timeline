# The Dark Ages

The period of stability that pervaded the Golden Age would suddenly come to an end. Each planet had been absorbing matter
and energy from the Sun growing in size throughout the *Golden Age* period. Eventually the planets become too large and
too energetic, and begin to oscillate violently in a new non-linear orbit beginning a long period of instability that
would come to define the *Dark Ages*.

Over the next **2,477 years** (3147–670 BCE), four planets would sequentially dominate Earth's sky — each worshipped as
a saviour before being remembered as a destroyer. This is the era of the Deluge, the Exodus, the Ten Plagues, the
Burning Bush, and the final stabilization of the Solar System.

## Orbital Year-Length Changes During the Dark Ages

Earth's orbital period changed dramatically as it moved between planetary configurations:
