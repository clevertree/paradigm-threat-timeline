# September 8 - Jupiter disappears and Venus attacks Earth

The last Absu layer surrounding the remaining planets became stressed as the nonlinear orbit became too wide to
support it. The configuration became unstable once again. Jupiter's coma-tail throne diminishes causing the gas giant
to pass through the Absu layer and disappear. The Sun turns red and vanishes. Absent the influence of Jupiter, and with
the Absu (heavens) sealed shut, _Mars and Venus go to war_. Gas planet Venus appeared disheveled as she "_laments_" at
the death of the King Jupiter. She became **The Dragon** and lashes out at Earth and Mars with her plasma tendrils. The
violent exchange between Earth and Venus **parts the sea** forcing open the aerial Absu layer and **turning the sea
red**, which bled across the sky for three days until only one Absu ring remained.
**This was the most terrifying moment in human history**. In [Recovering the Lost World](https://saturniancosmology.org)

As the Absu collapsed, the Earth was inundated with a Second Flood of epic proportions. The Christian Bible remembers
this event as Noah's Ark, but the real subtext for this event was
[the wholesale slaughter of humanity](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/syn.php). All civilizations across Earth recall
this destructive contact with the Raging Goddess, Witch (with broom), Dragon, or Comet. Venus was associated with
Hathor, Sekhmet, and Anath in Egypt, Tiamat in Mesopotamian, Kali in Hinduism,
and [Medusa](http://www.ifiseeu.com/venus-mars-myth/terrifying-glory.htm) in Greek Mythology. In the epic poem Beowulf,
Grendel (Venus) has his arm torn off "at the shoulder" symbolizing the severing of the plasma connection between Venus
and Saturn (Grendel's Mom).
