# Sodom and Gomorrah are completely destroyed by Mars.

With Jupiter's influence in decline and Venus absent, the nonlinear configuration continued to widen and destabilize.
The periodic cataclysmic encounters between Earth and Mars increase in duration and intensity. Eventually an alignment
between the planets Mars, Earth, and Mercury caused the complete destruction of the five _cities of the plain_ named in
Genesis 14:2:
**Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and Zoar**. Flaming sulfur from Mars fell to Earth as a miles-wide column of electric
discharge decimated the plain.

The [1611 KJV Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version) would later redact this famous natural cataclysm
into a story of human sin and divine retribution with homosexuality as the scapegoat justifying the retribution.
Nevertheless, some aspects of the story are true. Instant fossilization can occur during periods of interplanetary
discharge.
