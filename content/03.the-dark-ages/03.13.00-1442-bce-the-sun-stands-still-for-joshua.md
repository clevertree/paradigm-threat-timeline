# The sun stands still for Joshua

For another 50 years, the planet Venus appeared as a Comet in Earth's sky, until it too became 'fully charged' by the
Sun's energy, causing a violent flip in its polarity. This state transition which functions similarly
to [atomic electron transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_electron_transition)
would force Venus into a nose-dive towards its final orbit around the Sun. During this transition, the Earth was subject
to an incredibly strong _tilt_ in the Sun's magnetic current flow, which passes from pole to pole through the planet.
This temporary tilt resulted in the appearance of the *Sun reversing its motion in the sky*, as recorded
in [Joshua 10-13](http://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/JOSH+10.html#:~:text=On%20the%20day%20the).
In [Worlds in Collision](https://books.google.com/books?id=FJst27kSVBgC&pg=PA376&lpg=PA376&dq=The+physical+effects+of+retardation+or+reversal+of+the+earth)
Velikovsky explains how this might work:

> The physical effects of retardation or reversal of the earth in its diurnal rotation are differently
> evaluated by various scientists. Some express the opinion that a total destruction of the earth and
> volatilization of its entire mass would follow such slowing down or stasis. They concede,
> however, that destruction of such dimensions would not occur if the earth continued to rotate and
> only its axis were tilted out of its position. This could be caused by the earth's passing through a
> strong magnetic field at an angle to the earth's magnetic axis. A rotating steel top, when tilted by
> a magnet, continues to rotate. Theoretically, the terrestrial axis could be tilted for a certain length
> of time, and at any angle, and also in such a fashion that it would lie in the plane of the ecliptic.
> In that case, one of the two hemispheres —the northern or the southern—would remain in
> prolonged day, the other, in prolonged night.

In the Biblical Narrative, Moses (Gas-Giant Jupiter) had a successor named Joshua (Planet Venus). With the "Death" of
Moses, Joshua leads the fictional Israelites to Palestine. Joshua needs a decisive victory over the
fictional [5 kings of Makkedah](https://rpmdaily.net/blog/the-5-kings-of-makkedah-5-in-the-series#:~:text=five%20kings).
To accomplish this, Joshua speaks to an invisible "LORD" and requests his intervention in battle.
[Joshua 10](https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-13.htm) of the KJV Bible states:

> The day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel:
> “O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.
> Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down
> about a whole day.
> There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought
> for Israel


The Sun's proximity to Venus calms the dragon's rage as the gas planet transforms back into spherical shape. The orbits
of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter were now becoming stable around the Sun. The memory of planet Venus as the
Dragon or Comet [fades into myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dragons_in_mythology_and_folklore). As expected,
this story of natural cataclysm was then redacted into an epic fiction of _divine intervention_ in order to serve the
purposes of the **Deep State**. However, to normal folk this event symbolizes something else entirely; the *end* of
cataclysm; the Pantheon of Gods taking their leave to be replaced by the one "Lord", our Sun. As they became no
longer visible, humanity would forget the planets
and [polytheism would go into decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism). A great
confusion would begin over the nature of Gods.
[Velikovsky states](https://books.google.com/books?id=FJst27kSVBgC&pg=PA299):

> With Macrobius in the fourth Christian century, there begins a tendency to see in many gods of
> Egyptian and Greek antiquity the personification of the sun. Macrobius compared Osiris to the
> sun, and Isis to the moon, disregarding the opinion of earlier authors. He also interpreted Jupiter
> as the sun.
> As the role the planets played in the history of the world retreated ever further into oblivion, the
> interpretation of nature myths as referring to the sun or the moon became more and more
> widespread.
