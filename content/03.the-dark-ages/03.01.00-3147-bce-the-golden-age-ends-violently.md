# The Golden Age Ends Violently.

Within a very short time, all 9 planets (including Earth) break from the configuration and exit the outer layers
of Saturn's protective plasma sheath. The planets, having left Saturn's collinear configuration, violently competed with
each other for a place in a new orbit. They formed
an [in-parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Parallel_circuits)
circular _non-linear_ configuration that together orbits the Sun for the next 1655 years. Humanity encounters a new
unfamiliar influence (*death*) as it enters a period of extended darkness, famine, pestilence, and confusion.

## Earth's Orbit Changes: Year Extends to 240 Days

The Maya calendar starts with Earth jumping into its *second orbit* under Jupiter's influence
on [3114 B.C.E.](https://www.aaas.org/myths-mayan-long-count-calendar#:~:text=The%20Long%20Count%20is%20an,6%20in%20the%20Julian%20calendar)
with each year (orbit around the Sun) recorded as 240 days long. This would be the first time humanity got a peak at our
Sun and gas-giant Jupiter, which were hiding behind Saturn until now. This new Sun would prove to be too bright for most
to bear and life on earth escaped into dark caves to avoid it. Occasionally Jupiter would orbit in front of the Sun, and
together they would appear as a radiant throne in the sky.

> **Note on dates:** The breakup of the collinear configuration is dated to **3147 BCE**. The Mayan Long Count begins
> **33 years later** at **3114 BCE**, marking the point at which Earth had settled into Jupiter's new orbital
> configuration. Both dates are correct — they record different moments of the same transition.

> And the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
> their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty
> men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
> And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and
> from the wrath of the Lamb:
> For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

## The First Great Deluge

As Earth and the other planets passed through Saturn's outer plasma sheath (The _Absu_), the layer cooled
into [sodium-salt water](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20090624.html)
becoming heavy and crashing into the planet surface causing the **first great deluge**
by [each civilization](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Great_Flood). Earth receives its salty oceans from
Saturn, which is why the Atlantic ocean is also called the [Sea of Kronos](https://atlantipedia.ie/samples/sea-of-kronos/).
In modern times, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cannot legitimately answer the question:
[Why is the ocean salty, but rivers flowing into it are not?](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/riversnotsalty.html)

> Many great deluges have taken place during the [thousands of]

> by fire and other catastrophes was also common. In these
> floods, water rose from below, destroying city dwellers but not
> mountain people. The floods, especially the third great flood
> before Deucalion, washed away most of Athens' fertile soil.

> When the Sun Age came, there had passed 400 years. Then came 200 years, then 76. Then all mankind was lost and drowned
> and turned to fishes.
> The water and the sky drew near each other. In a single day all was lost, and Four Flower consumed all that there was
> of our flesh.
> The very mountains were swallowed up in the flood, and the waters remained, lying tranquil during fifty and two
> springs.

This was the *first* deluge — caused by passing through Saturn's Absu. A [second deluge](/content/03.the-dark-ages/03.05.00-2349-bce-jupiter-disappears-and-venus-attacks-earth.md) would follow centuries later when Jupiter's Absu collapsed at 2349 BCE.
