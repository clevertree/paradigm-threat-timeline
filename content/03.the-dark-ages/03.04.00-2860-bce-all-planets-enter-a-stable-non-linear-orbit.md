# All planets enter a stable non-linear orbit.

Jupiter's benevolent reign was a model of the ['Good King'](https://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/talbott/talbott.html)
that inspired the religions of many human nations for ages to come. Festivals around the
world [celebrate](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/festivals-dead-around-world-180953160/)
the death, resurrection, and intervention of Jupiter:
"All Saints Day" and "All Souls Day", Halloween, and "Day of the Dead" in Mexico. Jupiter's 511-year reign
was remembered across every culture as the archetype of the just ruler — from Zeus to Thor to King Arthur.
For the full account of Jupiter's dual nature as both saviour and destroyer, see

C.S. Lewis's "[The Chronicles of Narnia](http://www.mythsoc.org/reviews/planet-narnia.htm)"
featured an evil witch (Venus) who is intervened upon by a resurrected Lion (Jupiter). Each Narnia book secretly
represented a planet. Jupiter: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Mars: Prince Caspian. Sol: The Voyage of the “Dawn
Treader”. Luna (our Moon): The Silver Chair. Mercury: The Horse and his Boy. Venus: The Magician’s Nephew. Saturn: The
Last Battle.
