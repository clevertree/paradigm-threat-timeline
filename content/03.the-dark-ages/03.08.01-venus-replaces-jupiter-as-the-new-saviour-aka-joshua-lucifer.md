# Venus replaces Jupiter as the new Saviour (aka Joshua / Lucifer)

> *Each new saviour planet carried a dual nature: first as a liberator bringing order from chaos, then — as it too caused catastrophe — becoming the new archetype of evil. Venus is the clearest example of this pattern.*

## Venus the Saviour: Lucifer, the Light Bringer

The Latin word *Lucifer* — *lucem ferre*, "light-bearer" — was the Roman name for the dawn appearance of the
planet Venus heralding the morning. In its original, purely astronomical meaning, this was a name of profound
hope: the **brightest object in the dark sky**, appearing just before sunrise to signal that night had ended.

> language is used as a name for the dawn appearance of the planet Venus, heralding daylight."

When Jupiter's control over the inner solar system collapsed and the old Pyramidal Empire began to fail, Venus
blazed into prominence — brighter than anything humanity had seen since the departure of Saturn's Absu. For a
traumatized civilization living under a dark sky dominated by the charred remains of Jupiter's coma, this
**brilliant new light** was worshipped as a deliverer. It was called by many names:

- **Joshua** (Hebrew *Yehoshua* = "the Lord saves") — the leader who brings people from bondage to the Promised Land
- **Lucifer** — the light that precedes the Sun, the herald of a new day
- **Quetzalcoatl** — the Feathered Serpent, the brilliant morning star of Mesoamerican cosmology
- **Inanna / Ishtar** — the Sumerian/Akkadian goddess of love and war, the morning star
- **Aphrodite / Venus** — the most beautiful of the gods, born from the sea-foam (plasma discharge from the sea)

In every tradition, Venus-as-saviour shares the same attributes: **brilliance**, **beauty**, **female energy**
(in contrast to Jupiter's male authority), and an association with **liberation from the previous order**.

## Venus the Destroyer: The Dragon, the Serpent, the Devil

The same planet that was worshipped as the bringer of light became the most feared object in the ancient sky.
Venus, in its comet phase — ejected from the Jupiter encounter into a wildly eccentric orbit — generated a
massive plasma tail. Viewed from Earth, this tail appeared as a **multi-armed, writhing, multi-headed serpent**
or dragon. The ten plagues described in the Book of Exodus are the sequential plasma and electromagnetic
effects of Venus making a series of close passes by Earth at approximately 1492 BCE.

![The Ten Plagues were caused by the 'Pass-over' of Planet Venus in Comet form](/media/03.the-dark-ages/plagues_of_venus.jpg)

This is the same entity described as:

- **The Serpent in Eden** — the bringer of knowledge (plasma discharge illuminating the world) who causes the fall of paradise
- **Tiamat** — the Babylonian chaos dragon slain by Marduk (Jupiter), yet returning as the great adversary
- **Typhon** — the monstrous serpent that threatened to overthrow Zeus (Jupiter) himself
- **The Dragon** — in Revelation, the great dragon cast out of heaven by Michael (Mars), its tail sweeping a third of the stars

The transition of "Lucifer" from "morning star" to "the Devil" in post-New Testament theology directly mirrors
this astronomical duality. The same Venus that brought light and liberation was also the *fallen* object — it
had literally **fallen from its stable orbital position** into a catastrophic comet trajectory. Isaiah 14:12
*"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning"* is an accurate description of what humanity
observed: the greatest light in the dawn sky destabilized and began its terrifying close approaches to Earth.

> "The 'fallen angel,' Lucifer, in the guise of [a comet] — Helel ben Shahar (Lucifer), Tezcatlipoca, and
> Phaethon are exemplary" of this pattern across cultures.

## The Collapse of the Pyramidal Empire

With the departure of the planets from the nonlinear orbit dominated by Jupiter, the pyramids would no longer
function as quantum gateways. The Pyramidal Empire loses the ability to communicate between locations and
*simulate deities* within the pyramidal chambers. People quickly lose faith in stone idol-deities as the idols
fall permanently silent — because their animating planetary energy source is gone. All systems of control
rapidly fall apart.

Without servants, the many hundreds of massive pyramids across the Earth became uninhabitable and were
abandoned. The **Pyramidal Empire** had no choice but to go underground — literally and figuratively. The visible
creator god "Ra" became *invisible*, renamed
"[Amun-Ra](https://www.ancient.eu/amun/)": "the hidden one", "invisible", "mysterious of form". Amun-Ra was
elevated from creator of the Solar System into Creator of the Universe — the "Lord of All". Faith in the
existence of this newly refashioned *invisible creator god* became the fundamental test of Pyramidal Empire loyalty.

The significance of the Exodus Event is thus not the movement of a population but the **exodus from a slave
empire into freedom**. The freed slave populations who remained in the regions abandoned by the Pyramidal Empire
enjoyed a lasting period of peace. To this day, many
[non-Jewish populations, especially in Africa](https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/170393/),
remember and celebrate the 'Passover' of Comet Venus.
