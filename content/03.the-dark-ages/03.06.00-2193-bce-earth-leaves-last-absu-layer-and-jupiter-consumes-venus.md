# Earth leaves last Absu layer and Jupiter consumes Venus again

This new period of stability lasts another 156 years and ends abruptly when the nonlinear configuration loses its last
Absu layer. Exposed to the Sun's electromagnetic field, each planet formed its
own [magnetosphere](http://www.plasmacosmology.net/tech.html). Seasons began on Earth for the first time. The formations
of deserts during this period force the populations of Western Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and North Africa to
migrate. The Egyptian and [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) kingdoms collapse. The Earth is
still in the nonlinear orbit with Jupiter, and the year extends to 273 days. It would be another 200 years before Egypt
repopulates beginning the [Middle Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt) period. As Venus
became exposed to the Sun's field, it retreated into the safety of Jupiter's magnetosphere, and became once again
_consumed into the Gas Giant's interior_.

## Year Extends to 273 Days — Ice Age in the North

At the same time, northern populations of the Earth experienced an ice-age lasting well over 200 years.
In [Egyptian Myth and Catastrophism](http://firmament-chaos.com/papers/EgyptianarticleV2.pdf) Robert Ackerman explains:

> It is of interest that mythologies of countries where the fiery-dragon (proto-Venus)
> cannot be correlated with heat or drought, such as the Norse, preserve it as a representative of winter.
> This can be explained in the catastrophism scenario by the fact that during the Vedic Period, Proto-Venus,
> still sporting its comet-like tail, came closest to the Earth at the time of the release of
> priori-Mars from geosynchronous orbit. On those occasions the mantle of the Earth would return to
> its normal rotation about the North Pole, at which position the Norse lands would be much farther
> from the equator than when priori-Mars orbited the Earth.

## 2167 BCE — Jupiter Catches on Fire

Within 25 years, Gas-Giant Jupiter, still appearing on its coma-tail mountain, and having recently consumed Venus,
became fully exposed to the Sun's field and caught on fire for 20 straight years. Humans world-wide remembered this
epic spectacle as
[The Burning Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_bush) (Mosaic) or
[Chilam Balam](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/cbc/cbc15.htm) (Mayan)
and many others, even the Grateful Dead song [Fire On The Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pOKqcaR-A0). The
Old Testament story of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses)
redacts the planet saviour Jupiter (Zeus) into a mythical human prophet "Mo-Zeus" i.e. Moses who represents
a '[Universal Creator and Saviour God](https://sites.google.com/a/kent.edu/jwattles/home/comparative-religious-thought/judaism/moses-concept-of-god)'
. Under the changing influence of the gas giant, the Earth itself undergoes further cataclysm. In Hebrew and Egyptian
tradition, the Burning Bush was a sign that God (Jupiter) was unhappy with His creation (
Humanity). The Earth groaned, the ground vibrated, and a trumpeting sound was heard and _felt_ by every creature on the
planet up to [613](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments) times. Humans interpreted each exultation as a new
Commandment spoken directly by God. This became the basis of the 10 Commandments of
the [Mosaic Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_covenant).

This event symbolizes the end of King Jupiter's reign as well as a changing of the 'rules'. To most humans, Jupiter's epic
display meant once again that the _powers that be_ did not represent any gods. The **Pyramidal Empire** reacts to this new
reality by creating the [Abrahamic Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_pieces)
replacing their direct rulership with indirect religious mind-control. In Genesis 22, the Bible story of
the [Binding of Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac)
describes the new rules of the Covenant. Abraham was originally called Abram which has the word 'Ram' in it. In this Old
Testament narrative, God ordered Abram to sacrifice his son Isaac as a test of loyalty. Abram complies and goes through
with the sacrifice until he is stopped by emissaries of the age of Aries (the Ram). These emissaries inform Abram that
he may slaughter a ram instead of his child, and he then does so under this new covenant. Going forward, subjects would
be ordered to sacrifice animals to show their loyalty to the **Pyramidal Empire** and to its invisible god.
