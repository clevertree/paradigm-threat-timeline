# Jupiter replaces Saturn as the new Saviour (aka Zeus, Thor, King Arthur)

> *Each new saviour planet carried a dual nature: first as a liberator bringing order from chaos, then — as it too caused catastrophe — becoming the new archetype of evil. Jupiter was no exception.*

## Jupiter the Saviour: The Good King

Resolving the electric imbalances between the planets, Jupiter became
[King of the planets](http://www.empirerome.com/wordpress/?page_id=708)
in the [Roman Pantheon](https://frostydrew.org/publications.dc/show/entry-611/)
and reigned over a 511-year period of stability. King Jupiter sat upon the Cosmic Mountain, also remembered by different
populations as Mount Olympus, Mount Parnassus, Mount Sinai, and others. This appearance of a *cosmic mountain* was
actually Jupiter's South Pole plasma outpouring extended out into a massive coma tail. Once per orbit, Jupiter would
eclipse the Sun, and the King would wear the Sun's Corona as a Crown.

[Pre-Galfridian Arthurian legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur#Pre-Galfridian_traditions)
describes King Arthur (Jupiter) orbiting a *round table* along with the greatest knight of all — Lancelot (Mars) —
and the lesser knights. Together, the *Knights of the Round Table* defended Britain from fire-monsters (the Sun), as
well as dragons and witches (Venus). Jupiter was the mediating force — the great balancer — the King who kept chaos
at bay.

Across every culture, Jupiter-the-Saviour wore the face of a **just and benevolent ruler**:

- **Greek**: Zeus, king of the gods, father of Olympus, protector of order and civilization
- **Norse**: Odin/Thor, storm-bringer who nevertheless maintained the cosmic laws of the world-tree Yggdrasil
- **Babylonian**: Marduk, the dragon-slayer who built the first civilized order from the primordial chaos
- **Hindu**: Indra, the warrior-king who slew the cosmic serpent Vritra and released the waters for humanity
- **Celtic**: The Dagda, the "Good God" who wielded wisdom and abundance

## Jupiter the Destroyer: The Jealous Tyrant

Yet the same myths that celebrate Jupiter's kingship also record his **jealousy**, his **rage against his own
creations**, and his eventual **fall from grace**. The Greeks knew Zeus as a god who devoured his first wife
Metis whole — swallowing the goddess of wisdom to prevent a prophecy that her children would surpass him. In
myth, Zeus seduced and abandoned, struck down those who challenged him, and wielded his thunderbolt against his
own children.

This is not hypocrisy or editorial inconsistency. It is **accurate observational recording**. The very plasma
discharges from Jupiter's south pole that first brought order and stability were — as Jupiter's orbit grew more
unstable — the same forces that caused *destruction*. Jupiter's growing instability in the nonlinear orbit began
producing wildly unpredictable plasma events. At approximately 2349 BCE, Jupiter
[disappears from its position](/content/03.the-dark-ages/03.08.00-2349-bce-jupiter-disappears-and-venus-attacks-earth.md)
as the dominant planetary body, and in doing so it **consumes Venus** — drawing the newly emerging planet into
a close encounter that causes Venus to enter comet-mode, unleashing the era known as the Ten Plagues.

This moment — Jupiter swallowing/consuming Venus — is the same plasma event mythologized as:

- Zeus swallowing Metis (and giving "birth" to Athena — Venus — from his own brow)
- Chronos/Saturn devouring children (conflated with Jupiter by later writers)
- The Burning Bush at Sinai: Jupiter's plasma discharge signalling its anger at the world
- Thor's final battle with the Midgard Serpent at Ragnarok

Jupiter's burning was widely interpreted as a signal from God that the existing order had displeased the divine.
As archaeologically documented in [Jupiter catches on fire](/content/03.the-dark-ages/03.10.00-2167-bce-jupiter-catches-on-fire.md),
the planet's coma ignited. The Deep State exploited this spectacle by introducing "Mo-Zeus" (Moses) — a human
prophet who claimed to relay messages from the burning God. The **jealous, angry God** of the Old Testament was
born at this exact moment — a deliberate rebranding of Jupiter's physical violence into a theological command
structure.

> "The LORD your God, **who is among you**, is a jealous God… and He will wipe you off the face of the earth."
> -<cite>[Deuteronomy 6:14-16](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm)</cite>

The word *jealous* is the tell. A purely theological inventor of an "invisible God" would have no motive to
describe that God as jealous of visible things. Only a real physical entity — a planet whose worshippers could
observe its actual decline and be seduced by newer, brighter competitors — required the threat: *do not follow
other gods*. The "other gods" it feared were Venus, Mars, and the Sun, all of which would sequentially replace
it in humanity's devotion.

## The Fall of the Round Table

During this period, the nonlinear orbit between planets grew larger and more unstable, resulting in the
inevitable [Breaking of the Round Table](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2015/08/king-arthur-and-his-part-in-the-breaking-of-the-round-table/).
King Arthur "died" — Jupiter ceased to dominate the inner solar system — and the quest for the Holy Grail
(the restoration of the old divine order) became humanity's unfulfilled longing.

With Jupiter eclipsed, Venus entered the sky as the new brilliant body — simultaneously worshipped as the
**light bringer** and feared as the comet-dragon. The saviour succession continued.
