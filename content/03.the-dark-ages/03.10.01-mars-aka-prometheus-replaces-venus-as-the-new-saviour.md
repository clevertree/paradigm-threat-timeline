# Mars (aka Prometheus) replaces Venus as the new Saviour

> *Each new saviour planet carried a dual nature: first as a liberator bringing order from chaos, then — as it too caused catastrophe — becoming the new archetype of evil. Mars is mythology's most ironic case: the dragon-slayer who was also the dragon.*

## Mars the Saviour: Prometheus, the Fire-Giver

When Venus was finally conquered and settled into a less catastrophic orbit after the events surrounding the
Exodus, a new planetary body rose to prominence: **Priori-Mars**, appearing in geosynchronous orbit above the
northern hemisphere, looming enormous in the sky. After the terror of comet-Venus, the appearance of a
relatively stable, brilliant red body was a relief. Humanity interpreted it as another saviour.

In the [Greek narrative](https://www.ancient.eu/Prometheus/), Prometheus (Mars) thwarted Zeus/Jupiter's plan
by forcing humans to invent technology too early.
[Pandora's Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box#Difficulties_of_interpretation)
was a metaphor for the **Pyramidal Empire** plan to *rule Earth through evil* — through the strategic release of
suppressed technology, usury, religious mind control, greed, envy, hatred, pain, disease, hunger, poverty,
war, and death. The electric encounters with Mars quickly taught humans how to harness electricity and generate
their own. In the 7th century BCE, humanity enjoyed a lasting period of free energy, ideal health, and no
Pyramidal Empire influence as [magnificent cities](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-best-ancient-cities/index.html)
blossomed across the planet.

Mars-as-saviour appeared across cultures as:

- **Greek**: Prometheus, the titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity
- **Roman**: Mars Ultor ("Mars the Avenger") — champion of the people against cosmic tyranny
- **Norse**: Tyr, the one-handed god of war and justice — the just warrior who sacrificed himself for the binding of Fenrir
- **Hindu**: Karttikeya / Skanda, the divine warrior who overthrew the demonic forces
- **Mesopotamian**: Nergal, warrior of the underworld, eventually elevated as protector
- **Hebrew**: The Angel Michael — the warrior archangel who defeated the Dragon (Venus) and cast it from heaven

Mars's gift was understood to be **fire and electricity** — the practical knowledge of plasma. It demonstrated
on a cosmic scale that the Pyramidal Empire's "evil plan" (Pandora's Box) could be defeated. The conflict between
Mars and the remainders of the Jupiterian empire showed once again that the Pyramidal Empire did not represent the
divine — it was mortal, defeatable.

## Mars the Destroyer: The Red Dragon

Yet Mars was simultaneously **the most feared object in the ancient sky**. Appearing in a geosynchronous orbit
just 42,000 kilometres above Earth's surface, it was not a distant star — it was an enormous looming sphere
that periodically exchanged electric discharges with Earth. Its close approaches caused earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, tsunamis, and global electromagnetic storms.

The ancient world's most vivid mythological monsters are, on close inspection, Mars:

- **The Red Dragon** (Revelation 12: "the great red dragon... his tail swept a third of the stars of heaven") — Mars's plasma tail
- **Typhon** (Greek), **Vritra** (Hindu), **Apep** (Egyptian) — the great serpent-monster that battles the hero/sun
- **Set** (Egyptian) — the destroyer, the red-skinned god of chaos and storms, enemy of Osiris and Horus
- **Ares** (Greek) — despised even by his own father Zeus; the god of war's bloody, uncontrollable nature

The great irony of Ares/Mars in Greek mythology is explicit: **the other gods hated him**. Homer writes that
Zeus himself says of Ares, *"of all the gods who hold Olympus, I hate you the most."* He was feared as a
destroyer even by those who needed him as a protector. He was the saviour who terrified his worshippers.

## The Nine Deaths of Mars

Humanity knew this gift had come at a cost. With each encounter, the outer shell of
[Priori-Mars](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/2010/01/16/the-origin-of-avatar/)
collapsed, making the inner shell temporarily visible. The
[lightning scars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1e5_tB6Y) streaking across the surface of Mars led
humans to believe Prometheus was being punished for his gift:

> Eternal chains, bound to a mountain — his liver torn out each day by an eagle, regenerated each night, torn out again.

Nine times they watched as Mars's *"flesh"* was torn apart and sewn back together, only to be torn apart
again. This is both mythological memory of the repeated encounters (Mars giving technology/energy, then
retreating, then returning for another pass) and a physical description of what was observed in the sky: a
planet that seemed to die and be reborn in full view.

On **February 27, 747 BCE**, Mars bumped Earth's magnetosphere and once again altered the Earth's orbital
duration. Calendar keepers introduced a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) (every 4 years)
to account for the new 6-hour offset. Even this final gift — the stabilization of the calendar — was delivered
through catastrophe.

With Mars's final departure, the sky emptied of the terrifying close-encounter planets. What remained was
quieter, more predictable — and a new, reliable source of light and warmth stepped forward to fill the
theological vacuum.
