# Deep State breaks up the Hordian Empire

Placing the Romanov Dynasty at the highest level of authority in the Hordian Empire gave the Deep State a unique
opportunity to rewrite Russian history. The motive behind this redaction was to *fracture* the empire into controllable
states and then maximize their clandestine influence (*deep*) over each state. This is how the world-wide Hordian
Empire was erased-redacted from all published literature into *independent states history* under different names -
Russia, Turkey / Atamania as the Ottoman Empire, Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Spain,
Egypt, England, Middle East, Persia, China, Japan, India, America and many European, Asian and African countries.
Each region already had a vassal aristocratic family originally married into the Hordian Empire in its prime. As these
ties were cut, these families would become the Kings and Queens of *their own* states.

Although the Rus-Horde Empire was broken up, the Deep State and their Western vassal states still feared the eventual
reemergence of the old empire and began targeting its history and culture. They launched
a [modernization campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_reform_of_Peter_the_Great)
through their Romanov
puppet [Czar Peter I "The Great"](https://www.history.com/news/peter-the-great-tortured-killed-own-son) to
incorporate Russia into *'modern'* Europe. During his reign he reformed the calendar
and [alphabet](https://www.prlib.ru/en/history/619018), and moved the Russian Headquarters to St Petersburg. With these
reforms, the Deep State's objective was to put pressure on the Orthodox Church's autonomy, significantly reducing its
religious influence. This campaign
of [Anti-Russian Sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Russian_sentiment#18th_and_19th_centuries) would continue
for the next 3 centuries and
is [still active today](https://www.rt.com/russia/569147-zakharova-odessa-monuments-history/).
Fomenko [describes the redaction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html#the703):

> The Romanovs re-wrote the history of Russia. In particular, the Russian-Horde army was declared to be an evil foreign
> power, which conquered not just Western Europe – now it is only mentioned in passing – but allegedly Russia itself.
