# Spawning of the First Life Forms

The memory of the moment of 'creation' shared by
[different mythologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creation_myths) was witnessed by life forms
that had *already spawned* and were capable of remembering it and recording it later during the Golden Age.
The [Younger Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda) states:

> And when the heated blasts from Muspelheim met the rime [of the rivers], so that it melted into drops,
> then, by the might of him who sent the heat, the drops quickened into life and took the likeness of a man,
> who got the name Ymer.

Every mythology (including the Bible) states that powerful forces in the sky spawned all life forms (including humans)
after its own image - an image which changed many times. As the Golden Age approached, the 3 southern plasmoids took on
different shapes, generating different animal energy patterns until finally the plasmoids formed the
[First Man](https://www.olivehackney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Year-5-History-and-Reading-Maya-Civilization-Creation-Story-Comprehension-with-Answers.pdf)
pattern. This ideal pattern in the southern sky provided the

humans.
