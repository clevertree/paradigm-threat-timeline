# Spawning of the First Life Forms

![Spawning of the First Life Forms](/media/01.before-creation/spawning-first-life-forms.png)

The memory of the moment of 'creation' shared by
[different mythologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creation_myths) was witnessed by life forms
that had *already spawned* and were capable of remembering it and recording it later during the Golden Age.
The [Younger Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda) states:

> And when the heated blasts from Muspelheim met the rime [of the rivers], so that it melted into drops,
> then, by the might of him who sent the heat, the drops quickened into life and took the likeness of a man,
> who got the name Ymer.

Every mythology (including the Bible) states that powerful forces in the sky spawned all life forms (including humans)
after its own image - an image which changed many times. As the Golden Age approached, the 3 southern plasmoids took on
different shapes, generating different animal energy patterns until finally the plasmoids formed the
[First Man](https://www.olivehackney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Year-5-History-and-Reading-Maya-Civilization-Creation-Story-Comprehension-with-Answers.pdf)
pattern. This ideal pattern in the southern sky provided the

humans.

## Saturn's Plasma Strikes as the Engine of Speciation

Jno Cook's *Recovering the Lost World* argues in [Chapter 7: Ice Ages and Humans](https://saturniancosmology.org/ice.php)
that the entire biological history of Earth — every major extinction event and every burst of speciation — can be
attributed to Saturn's periodic plasma contacts with Earth. The interval between these contacts has been estimated at
**26–27 million years**, matching the interval between known mass extinctions since the Cambrian (560 mya):

> *"The biology of Earth is such a complete accident and so utterly unlikely that it will not have ever been duplicated
> anywhere, at any time, among the billions of other star systems. But here on Earth, all of it, especially the rise of
> complex species since the Cambrian Period, 560 million years ago, can be attributed to a series of cataclysmic plasma
> strikes by Saturn, each of a very long duration."*

## The First Man Pattern: Plasmoid as Blueprint

As the 10,900 BC–8347 BC period of the Peratt Column wound down, the three southern ball plasmoids cycled through
a sequence of morphological forms before extinguishing — including the **squatting man** / standing humanoid figure
that Peratt's analysis of 4,000,000 petroglyphs identified as the most widely reproduced image in human prehistory.

This is the "First Man" encoded in myth worldwide — not an ancestor, but the plasma template from which the first
humans believed themselves to have been made:

- **Hebrew**: Adam Kadmon — the primordial cosmic human whose body was the template for creation
- **Hindu**: Purusha — the cosmic man from whose dismembered body the universe was constructed
- **Vedic/Mesoamerican**: the squatting deity of lightning and sky (Huracan / God K)
- **Norse**: Ymer — born of the heat from Muspelheim (the southern plasma column) meeting the rime of the rivers

The Younger Edda's description of Ymer is a direct mythological encoding of the plasma mechanism: the heat from the
southern column (Muspelheim) ionizes the cold primordial waters, and from the charged plasma drops *life quickens*
into the likeness of a man. This is not allegory. It is a description of an observed sky event and its interpreted
biological consequence, preserved in oral tradition for thousands of years.

## Homo sapiens and the Upper Paleolithic Revolution

The abruptness of the Upper Paleolithic transition — what archaeologists James Shreeve and others have called a
revolution with no precedent — is fully consistent with an external speciation event rather than internal evolutionary
pressure. Cook summarises:

> *"We, Homo sapiens, did not slowly evolve from these hominids. When we do finally appear, it is complete and with
> astounding suddenness — and with hundreds of specific stone tools, spear throwers, detachable harpoons, serrated
> knives, thread cutters, basketry, weaving, beads, and cosmetics."*
> — Jno Cook, [Chapter 7: Ice Ages and Humans](https://saturniancosmology.org/ice.php)

The conventional "out of Africa" hypothesis — driven largely by political considerations according to geneticist
R. A. Fonda — cannot account for the simultaneous global appearance of the same material culture package.
A plasma speciation event of sufficient intensity, acting on dispersed *H.erectus* populations across Northeastern
Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa simultaneously, produces the observed pattern: multiple independent origin points,
rapid spread, rapid elimination of competing species, and an immediate, fully-formed cultural explosion.
