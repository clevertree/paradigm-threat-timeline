# The Brother on the Cross

## What the Church Does Not Want You to Know

After 6 hours on the cross, the condemned man passed out and was stabbed by a soldier's spear, spilling blood and water
from his body. The body was removed from
the cross [by Christ's own family](https://www.jesus-story.net/descent/) who brought it into a nearby cave to avoid
further mutilation. The smaller humans, fearing retribution, *did not follow*. At some point in the next 3 days, the
family departs for Crimea [without fanfare or witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_tomb). There is no reason
whatsoever to assume the cave was [used for burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_of_Jesus).

Then Christ was [seen alive](https://rsc.byu.edu/jerusalem-zarahemla/when-did-jesus-visit-americas) -- many times,
in many places, in Asia and America. How is this possible?

## The Japanese Tradition: Isukiri Died in Christ's Place

In an [alternate version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Jesus) of the history preserved in Shingo, Japan,
Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead, his younger brother Isukiri took his place, while Jesus
escaped east across Siberia to Mutsu Province in northern Japan. A sign at the site reads:

![Tomb of Christ in Shingo, Japan - Sawaguchi family residence](/media/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/tomb_of_christ_and_brother.jpg)
*Shingo is the location of what is purported to be the resting place of Jesus, the "Tomb of Christ" (Kirisuto no haka), and the residence of Jesus' descendants, the Sawaguchi family.*

> When Jesus Christ was 21 years old, he came to Japan and pursued knowledge of divinity for 12 years.
> He went back to Judea at age 33, and engaged in his mission.
> However at that time people in Judea would not accept Christ's preaching.
> Instead, they arrested him and tried to crucify him on a cross.
> His younger brother Isukiri casually took Christ's place and ended his life on the cross.
> Christ, who escaped the crucifixion, went through the ups and downs of travel and again came to Japan.
> He settled right here in what is now called Herai Village, and died at the age of 106.
> On this holy ground, there is dedicated a burial mound on the right to deify Christ, and a grave on the left to deify Isukiri.
>
> The above description was given in a testament by Jesus Christ.

This timeline adopts the Japanese tradition as its primary account: **Isukiri died on the cross. Christ survived.**

The crowd at the crucifixion could not tell the difference between two giant brothers -- and likely did not care.
Giants were alien to the smaller humans of Istanbul. Two enormous, hairy figures bound to crosses would have been
indistinguishable to people who had rarely interacted with giants up close. The story only needed to hold for a few
hours. By the time anyone thought to ask questions, the surviving Christ was already gone.

## Romulus and Remus: The Same Story, Redacted

Fomenko identifies Romulus as a partial reflection of Christ and Remus as a partial reflection of
[John the Baptist](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_19.html) -- Christ's brother or cousin (Remus is
reflection #13 in Fomenko's list of 39 phantoms of John the Baptist). In the Roman founding myth, two brothers are
raised together, one kills the other, and the survivor founds a world empire. The parallel is exact:

- **Romulus** (Christ) survives and founds Rome (the Rus-Horde Empire)
- **Remus** (John the Baptist / Isukiri) dies, and his death becomes the mythic foundation of the new state

Fomenko demonstrates this at length in his
[XIII century chapter](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html): the Roman legends of Romulus and Remus
"partially absorbed the biblical details about Christ and John the Baptist." The She-Wolf who suckles the twins is
the Virgin Mary (or the Volga River). The founding of "ancient Rome" by the descendants of Aeneas -- Romulus and
Remus -- is the rise of Russia-Horde in the XIII-XIV centuries. Georgiy Danilovich (Genghis Khan) and Ivan Danilovich
(Batu Khan) are the historical Romulus and Remus.

While Fomenko does not explicitly connect the Romulus-kills-Remus episode to a brother-substitution at the crucifixion,
the implication is difficult to miss. Fomenko documents that ancient authors *constantly* confused Christ and John
the Baptist -- conflating their biographies, swapping their roles, merging them into single characters. This is
precisely what we would expect if the historical record was systematically redacted to suppress the most embarrassing
moment in Church history: **they publicly crucified the "King of the Jews" only to have him walk out alive days later
and go on to found the largest empire the medieval world had ever seen.**

The Church had every reason to bury the existence of a brother. If the public learned that Christ survived -- that the
crucifixion was a failure, that the revolution was never defeated, that the "risen savior" was simply a man who walked
away -- the entire theological edifice collapses. No resurrection. No divine sacrifice. No atonement. Just a botched
execution and a cover story. The redactors did what they could: they split the brother into dozens of phantom characters
(John the Baptist, Remus, Isukiri, and 36 others), placed as much narrative distance as possible between Christ and
any sibling, and rewrote the survival as a supernatural resurrection that *required faith* rather than an earthly
escape that required only two brothers who looked alike.

## The Backfire

The Monotheists (Pharisees) who ordered the crucifixion didn't realize that the revolution Christ started would
survive his apparent death. Before Christ, the martyring of popular revolutionary figures had always had the same
effect -- the permanent defeat of the revolution. The success of Christ's movement may be a result of a truly unique
circumstance: *the leader was never actually killed.*

With the act of crucifying "Christ," the Church had declared far and wide that he was **not the messiah** nor the
King of the Jews. Ironically, the idea sprung into the medieval mind -- that Christ **was actually the messiah** but
had been denied by the Jews. To make things worse for the Church's authority, the locals started comparing Christ to
the 2nd savior of Earth -- planet Jupiter. In the legend, king Jupiter (i.e. King Arthur, Zeus etc.) "dies" during
the dark ages, disappearing into a cave (the Absu layer), and reemerging after 2.5 days to once again sit on a throne
of plasma discharge and be crowned with the sun's light. The Church's crucifixion had backfired, creating their worst
nightmare -- a human Savior of *eastern* bloodlines worshiped as a god by the west.

The Monotheists hated Christ and his reform movement so much they refused to mention his name for the next 200 years,
at which point they accepted his popularity and retroactively named him the Savior of Mankind, the Messiah,
and *the Je-Zeus* -- merging the 'pagan' historical Christ with their old Hellenistic savior-Zeus, i.e. Son of God.

Fomenko demonstrates how this event became duplicated by historians of the Reformation:
[113 reflections of Andronicus-Christ](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_18.html),
[59 reflections of Virgin Mary](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_19.html),
[39 reflections of John the Baptist](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_20.html),
and [61 reflections of Judas Iscariot](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_20.html).
