# The Brother on the Cross

## What the Church Does Not Want You to Know

After 6 hours on the cross, the condemned man passed out and was stabbed by a soldier's spear. The body was removed [by Christ's own family](https://www.jesus-story.net/descent/) and brought into a nearby cave. The smaller humans, fearing retribution, *did not follow*. Within 3 days, the family departed for Crimea [without fanfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_tomb). There is no reason to assume the cave was [used for burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_of_Jesus).

Then Christ was [seen alive](https://rsc.byu.edu/jerusalem-zarahemla/when-did-jesus-visit-americas) — many times, in many places, in Asia and America.

## The Japanese Tradition: Isukiri Died in Christ's Place

In an [alternate version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Jesus) preserved in Shingo, Japan, Christ did not die on the cross. His younger brother Isukiri took his place, while Jesus escaped east across Siberia to northern Japan.

*Shingo: purported resting place of Jesus ("Tomb of Christ") and residence of his descendants, the Sawaguchi family.*

> When Jesus Christ was 21 years old, he came to Japan and pursued knowledge of divinity for 12 years. He went back to Judea at age 33 and engaged in his mission. However people in Judea would not accept Christ's preaching. Instead, they arrested him and tried to crucify him. His younger brother Isukiri casually took Christ's place and ended his life on the cross. Christ escaped and again came to Japan. He settled in what is now called Herai Village, and died at the age of 106.

This timeline adopts the Japanese tradition: **Isukiri died on the cross. Christ survived.** The crowd could not tell the difference between two giant brothers — giants were alien to the smaller humans of Istanbul. Two enormous figures on crosses would have been indistinguishable.

## Romulus and Remus: The Same Story, Redacted

Fomenko identifies Romulus as a partial reflection of Christ and Remus as John the Baptist (reflection #13 in Fomenko's 39 phantoms). Two brothers raised together, one kills the other, the survivor founds a world empire:

- **Romulus** (Christ) survives and founds Rome (the Rus-Horde Empire)
- **Remus** (John the Baptist / Isukiri) dies, founding the mythic basis of the new state

The She-Wolf who suckles the twins is the Virgin Mary (or the Volga River). The "ancient Rome" founded by Romulus and Remus is the rise of Russia-Horde in the XIII–XIV centuries. Fomenko documents [at length](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html) that ancient authors constantly confused Christ and John the Baptist — precisely what we'd expect if the record was redacted to suppress the most embarrassing moment in Church history: **they crucified the "King of the Jews" only to have him walk out alive and found the largest empire the medieval world had ever seen.**

The Church had every reason to bury the brother's existence. The redactors split him into dozens of phantom characters (John the Baptist, Remus, Isukiri, and 36 others) and rewrote the survival as a supernatural resurrection *requiring faith* rather than an earthly escape requiring only two brothers who looked alike.

## The Backfire

The Monotheists who ordered the crucifixion didn't realize the revolution would survive. Before Christ, martyring popular figures had always defeated the movement. Christ's movement may have succeeded because *the leader was never actually killed.*

By crucifying "Christ," the Church declared he was **not the messiah**. Ironically, the medieval mind concluded the opposite — that Christ *was* the messiah but had been denied by the Jews. Worse, people began comparing Christ to Jupiter — the 2nd savior who "dies," disappears into a cave (the Absu), and reemerges after 2.5 days to sit on a throne of plasma. The crucifixion had created their worst nightmare: a human savior of *eastern* bloodlines worshipped as a god by the west.

The Monotheists refused to mention his name for 200 years, then accepted his popularity and retroactively named him the Savior of Mankind — *the Je-Zeus* — merging the historical Christ with their Hellenistic savior-Zeus.

Fomenko documents the duplications: [113 reflections of Christ](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_18.html), [59 of Virgin Mary](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_19.html), [39 of John the Baptist](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_20.html), and [61 of Judas Iscariot](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_20.html).
