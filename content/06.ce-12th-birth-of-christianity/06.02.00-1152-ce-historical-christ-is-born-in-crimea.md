# Historical Christ is Born in Crimea

Christ's mother Katya was one of those [attempting to flee the census](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md). As a [hairy giant](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) from Rus', she knew what the census meant for her kind — it was not a count, but a prelude to genocide. She made it as far as Crimea before
being caught. However, the locals of Crimea took pity on her as she was moaning in pain with a difficult pregnancy. The
language barrier prevented the humans from asking Katya who the father was, and many assumed she was a prostitute, or a
virgin. It's possible her husband was killed by smaller humans, and she *simply refused to talk* about it. She couldn't
fit inside the buildings and had to be put in a horse stable where the locals performed a cesarean section.

## The Cesarean Section and the "Perpetual Virginity"

Fomenko demonstrates that the word "caesarean" itself derives from Christ's birth. In the Church Slavonic liturgy,
the irmos of the ninth song reads: "Him, who before the Sun shined, and in flesh came *from virgin's side*, infinitely
incarnated, we praise You, Mother of God." The words "came in flesh from virgin's side"
[describe nothing other than a cesarean section](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02.html). The Greek word
PARTHENOS (virgin) originates from the Slavonic POROT', meaning "to cut open" -- referring to the incision itself. The
persistent Church claim that Mary "remained a virgin after giving birth" is literally true under a cesarean:
the birth canal was never used.

According to [eastern chronicles](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_18.html), the difficult procedure resulted in
the stabbing of the infant Christ while still in the womb, leading to the traditions of the
[Holy Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance) and [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail).
It is possible that this birth wound was later conflated by chroniclers with the lance of the Roman soldier who stabbed
Christ at the crucifixion, merging two separate piercings into a single Holy Lance tradition. Fomenko does not address
this connection directly; we note it as an editorial observation.

Eventually the local authorities agreed to let the giants live, as long as they were Baptized and inducted into
Monotheism.

## The Magi: Rus-Horde Rulers Accept Christ

In the epoch of Christ's birth, Rus' adopted Christianity wholly and instantly. Fomenko
[identifies the Biblical Magi](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02.html) as three Rus-Horde rulers: Russian Czar
Vladimir (Balthazar), Czaritsa Malka -- his mother (Melchior), and a Cossack military Ataman (Caspar). They came to
worship the infant Christ and are represented in the Gospels as the Three Kings. A magnificent Cologne Cathedral was
erected in their honor, where the famous sarcophagus of the Three Kings was placed. Remarkably, medieval images of the
Magi depict the adoration set against banners displaying *a crescent and a star* -- the recognized symbol of Czar-Grad
(Jerusalem), confirming the Gospel events took place in Czar-Grad, not Palestine. Even more telling: in the Shrine of
the Three Kings at Cologne, two Magi are portrayed as bearded men, but the third figure standing between them is
*clearly female* -- the Russian queen Malka, later turned into a man by Western artists uncomfortable with the Slavic
origins of the Magi.

## Christ's Education and Conflict with the Church

Christ later traveled with his family to Jerusalem in Istanbul where he trained as a Rabbi. In Jerusalem, rabbis would
endlessly deliberate to bridge the gap between ancient Monotheism and the eclectic polytheistic indigenous religions of
the east they were trying to subsume. This strategy backfired as Christ and his mother Katya remained unconvinced of
the Church's conclusions and authority, deferring instead to her eastern Rus' heritage and the belief systems she was
raised in.
As a result of Christ's [clerical criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple), his
family was driven out of Jerusalem. The Gospel of Matthew contains a redacted version of this true story in the
[escape of the Holy Family](https://www.memphistours.com/Egypt/WikiTravel/History-Egypt/wiki/Holy-Family-in-Egypt) from
King Herod to Egypt, when in eastern records they were fleeing the persecution in Istanbul back
to their home in Rus' -- what would later become the Rus-Horde Empire.

After arriving safely at home, Christ developed a following based on his hybridized religious teachings. The religion of
Christianity formed around a series of parables as he demonstrated that people were born free from mental and physical
slavery and didn't need to obey the Church or any God. This following spread quickly back to Istanbul, and once again
challenged the foundations of Monotheism. The Deep State reacted -- laying plans to capture him and neutralize his
influence. He was invited to a passover celebration in Jerusalem, where he was promptly arrested, put on trial, and
crucified. The charge against him was insurrection, but not for *challenging Monotheism* -- rather, he was
accused of being the *King* of the Monotheists (Jews), a claim he never made.
