# 12th Century C.E. Birth of Christianity

In Fomenko's New Chronology, the first widely recorded and _purely human_ event was the crucifixion of Andronicus Christ
in 1185. Biographies of Czar-Grad's 'Byzantine' Emperor Andronicus and the Great Russian
Prince [Andrey Bogoliubsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Bogolyubsky) exist as surviving testimonies about the
historical Christ which match up nicely to the redacted New Testament literature put out by the Catholic Church, but
differ in many significant details. For example, Christ was of
a [race of hairy human giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP1ryzrzjAU) similar to the
mythical [Sasquatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot).
He was born in the year 1152 AD *(rather than around 4 BC)*, in modern-day Crimea (rather than Palestine), and his
mother Katya (later renamed Mary in the Latin bible) was originally from Rus' -- probably
from [Rostov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov) or nearby, and was buried in the Crimea. The far-eastern region
later called [Cathaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathay) was likely named *after* Katya, not the other way around --
a consequence of the Rus-Horde Empire centering its state religion on veneration of the Mother of God, long before it
ever centered on her Son.

During this period, the [Deep State Holy Empire](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.00-deep-state-centralize-world-religion-at-jerusalem.md)
spanned from Western Europe to Istanbul with Jerusalem #1 as their capital. Their slow-and-go plan was to spread a
centralized usury religion based on redacted old-testament narratives and an invisible creator lord which their priests
spoke for. This plan was foiled in less than a decade by Christ -- the Church's "prodigal child" -- who returned
triumphantly to Jerusalem proselytizing an anti-establishment religion promising freedom from tyranny and an end to
usury. The Church regarded Christ exactly as the parable describes: a wayward son who rejected his priestly inheritance,
abandoned the institution that raised him, and lived among commoners. In the Church's own retelling -- redacted into the
New Testament -- the prodigal son's "return" is recast as a voluntary sacrifice: he allows himself to be crucified,
seeking forgiveness from the Father. In reality, Christ never sought forgiveness. He was captured and executed. The
parable was reappropriated to make an execution look like a homecoming.

This forced the hand of the Deep State which saw no other option than to crucify Christ in a gruesome public display
within the tall gates of [Troy](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.00-deep-state-centralize-world-religion-at-jerusalem.md).
The objective of the crucifixion was to put down his insurrection and make an example of its leader. But the plan
backfired catastrophically: Christ's brother died on the cross in his place, and Christ himself survived to found a
world empire that would challenge the Church's authority for centuries.
