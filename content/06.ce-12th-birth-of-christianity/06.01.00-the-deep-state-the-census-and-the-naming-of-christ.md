# The Deep State, the Census, and the Naming of Christ

## The Giants and the Deep State

The normal-sized humans of the Deep State had a rocky history with the Giants — who remembered their enslavement by the
Pyramidal Empire. Giants were notoriously difficult to convert into Monotheism. They had their own religions, (large)
bibles, and a significant following of normal-sized humans. The Deep State knew they would never rule world religions
as long as the Giants existed. If they could only eliminate them all, then normal-sized humans would fall under the
influence of Deep State religions.

## The Census

The Latin Bible contains a *western* perspective of the Crucifixion, a story originally written in the Cyrillic bible,
but many of the facts are the same. The story of Christ began with
the [census](https://www.christianity.com/jesus/birth-of-jesus/bethlehem/was-there-really-a-census-at-the-time-of-jesuss-birth.html)
ordered by the religious leaders of Jerusalem in Istanbul. However, it is illogical to suggest that a pregnant woman
(who is due) would be forced to travel to take part in a census. That *never happens* in any census. Instead, the
census was of a very different nature; the Deep State was counting the giants of the region in preparation for a
*planned genocide* of giants.

At the same time, the Deep State prioritized the *conversion* of giants into Monotheism (if at all possible). They saw
the Baptism of the giant Andronicus Christ as a unique opportunity to spread their influence east. With the census, many
giants were fleeing the Istanbul region knowing what the census would mean for them if they stayed put — and many giants
were killed en route.

## The Naming of Christ

Christ means "anointed one" — meaning he was anointed with oil as part of the ancient Deep State ritual
of [Baptism](https://redeeminggod.com/egyptian-baptism/). This was unique for only one reason — Christ and his mother
were [large hairy humans](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) from Rus', a land of giants that rarely
participated in any Deep State religious ceremonies. This land would birth the first world empire since the dark ages
and would come to be known as the Kingdom of Tartaria.

The Church was building a patriarchal religion — authority passed from God the Father, to Christ the Son, to the male
apostles, to the male priesthood. Christ's hairy giant mother, carrying the matrilineal tradition of Rus', threatened
this entire structure. In the eastern tradition she came from, religious heritage passed through the **mother**, not
the father. A pregnant "Wild Woman" fleeing the census represented everything the Deep State sought to eliminate.
