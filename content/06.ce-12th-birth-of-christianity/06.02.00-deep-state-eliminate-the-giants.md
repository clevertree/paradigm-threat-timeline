# Deep State Eliminate the Giants

The normal-sized humans of the Deep State had a rocky history with the Giants - who remembered their enslavement by the
Pyramidal Empire. Giants were notoriously difficult to convert into Monotheism. They had their own religions, (large)
bibles, and a significant following of normal-sized humans. The Deep State knew they would never rule world religions
as long as the Giants existed. If they could only eliminate them all, then normal-sized humans would fall under the
influence of Deep State religions.
