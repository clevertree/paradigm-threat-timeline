# Hairy Mary: The Wild Woman Who Threatened Patriarchal Religion

![Hairy Mary](/media/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/hairy-mary.png)
*Another depiction of the hairy Mary tradition — Wild Women were portrayed with full body hair, nursing children, living outside of Church society. The iconography encodes a memory of a real human phenotype, not a theological metaphor.*

## Why Was Christ's Mother Depicted as Hairy?

The standard art-history explanation claims that medieval artists confused Mary Magdalene with Mary of Egypt, a desert hermit whose clothes rotted away until her hair grew to cover her body. But art historian Magdalena Łanuszka [rejects this explanation](https://en.posztukiwania.pl/2018/11/10/hairy-mary-one-more-time/):

> "In the late Middle Ages in Central Europe (in the 15th and early 16th century) both these saints were venerated and most likely people did distinct their legends... I am pretty convinced that the medieval viewer, looking at a hirsute Mary Magdalene, most likely saw her as a **Wild Woman**!"

The Wild Men and Wild Women (Wildweibchen) were a distinct iconographic tradition in medieval art — hairy, self-sufficient humans who lived in the wilderness outside of civilization. They appear throughout tapestries, wall-paintings, manuscript margins, and playing cards of the 15th century. The [Met Museum](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/364585) holds an engraving by Master ES depicting a "Wild Woman with Unicorn" — combining symbols of lust (Wild Woman) and chastity (Unicorn) in a single paradoxical image.

*Hairy Mary Magdalene from the "Body and Soul: Sculpture in Italy from Donatello to Michelangelo" exhibit. Medieval and Renaissance artists across Central Europe depicted Mary covered in body hair — not as artistic confusion, but as deliberate iconography identifying her as a "Wild Woman" (Wildweibchen).*


## The Church's Reframing: Wild People as "Sinful Humanity"

Łanuszka notes that in medieval art, Wild Men "symbolised **sinful humanity**." This is exactly what we would expect if the Church sought to demonize a population it intended to eliminate. Before you can commit genocide, you must first render the target population morally inferior — subhuman, sinful, animalistic.

The timing is suggestive: "I think it is not a coincidence that **hirsute Magdalene disappeared from the Western art around the same time when Wild Men lost their popularity in visual culture**." The iconographic tradition vanished because the living memory of actual hairy humans had been extinguished — or deliberately erased.

## The Pregnant Hairy Woman Fleeing the Census

Why would a pregnant woman, due to give birth, undertake a dangerous journey during a census? The standard Gospel narrative makes no sense: no census in history has ever required pregnant women to travel. The answer is that Mary was not traveling *to* the census — she was **fleeing** it.

The census was targeting her kind: hairy giants from Rus'. And she was demonstrably pregnant. In 15th-century Netherlandish paintings, Mary Magdalene is repeatedly depicted in **unlaced maternity dresses** — the period's recognizable signal of pregnancy. Professor Penny Howell Jolly documents this pattern in *Picturing the 'Pregnant' Magdalene in Northern Art, 1430-1550* (Ashgate, 2014).

Most strikingly, in Rogier van der Weyden's *Descent from the Cross* (before 1443, Prado, Madrid), [Mary Magdalene wears a belt inscribed **"JHESUS MARIA"**](https://en.posztukiwania.pl/2014/07/22/pregnant-mary-magdalene/) — as if the unborn child bore the names of its parents.

If Mary was a hairy giant from Rus', and the census was a prelude to genocide, her flight makes perfect sense. She knew what was coming.

## The Existential Threat: Matrilineal vs Patrilineal Religion

Christ's mother posed an existential threat to the nascent Church — not because of her teachings, but because of her **lineage**. In the eastern Rus' tradition she came from, religious heritage passed through the **mother**, not the father. This is the older, matrilineal pattern preserved in Judaism (one is Jewish if one's mother is Jewish) and in countless pre-Christian traditions.

The Church was building a **patriarchal religion** — authority passed from God the Father, to Christ the Son, to the male apostles, to the male priesthood. A prominent female figure at the center of the story, passing down religious authority through the maternal line, threatened the entire structure. If Christ's mother was the source of his religious legitimacy rather than his baptism by the (male) Church, then the Church's claim to authority collapsed.

The Church's solution was threefold:
1. **Conflate all the Marys** into one safely domesticated figure — Virgin Mary, the passive vessel
2. **Split off the threatening aspects** — make Mary Magdalene a separate, sinful prostitute-turned-penitent
3. **Eliminate the Wild People** — the genocide of hairy giants removed the living evidence of the old matrilineal tradition

## The Trojan War: A War Over the "Woman"

According to [Fomenko's reconstruction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03.html), the Trojan War was not literally about a woman named Helen. The Bible and medieval chronicles often used "wives" to represent **religions**:

> "As there existed a medieval tradition to nominally call different religions 'wives', i.e. women, then the cause of the Trojan = Tarquinian = Gothic war could have been a **RELIGIOUS DISPUTE**: whose religion or 'wife', was better. The grounds to war was the offence to a religion or 'wife'."

The "woman" at the center of the Trojan War was Mary — the Mother of God, the religious tradition of Rus'. The war was:

> "Revenge for insulting the Mother of God – for the execution of her Son Jesus Christ."

In this light, the Trojan War narrative preserves the memory of a civilizational conflict between two religious systems:
- **The Eastern/Matrilineal tradition** — represented by Mary, the Wild Woman, the hairy giants of Rus'/Jotunheim
- **The Western/Patrilineal tradition** — represented by the Deep State priesthood, the census, the systematic elimination of the old order

The "abduction of Helen" was the Church's appropriation of Mary's story — taking her from the eastern tradition and reframing her within the western patriarchal narrative.

## The Self-Sufficient Must Be Eliminated

The hairy giants were dangerous to the Deep State for the same reason the [Atlantean survivor class](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.07.00-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md) was dangerous: **they were self-sufficient**. They could live in the wilderness without buildings, without money, without Church infrastructure. They didn't need the Deep State's salvation.

This is the same pattern that recurs throughout history: the elimination of populations that cannot be economically controlled. The hairless, small humans who remained after the census-genocide were the kind that required shelter, purchased food, and depended on institutional authority for survival. They were governable.

Christ's mother, fleeing the census with her unborn child, represented the last iteration of an older humanity — Wild People who carried the matrilineal religious tradition, who could survive outside civilization, who threatened the patriarchal Church simply by existing.
