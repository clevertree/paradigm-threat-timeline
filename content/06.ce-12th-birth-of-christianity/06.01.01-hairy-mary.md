# Hairy Mary: The Wild Woman Who Threatened Patriarchal Religion

*Wild Women were portrayed with full body hair, nursing children, living outside of Church society. The iconography encodes a memory of a real human phenotype.*

## Why Was Christ's Mother Depicted as Hairy?

Art historian Magdalena Łanuszka [rejects](https://en.posztukiwania.pl/2018/11/10/hairy-mary-one-more-time/) the standard explanation that medieval artists confused Mary Magdalene with Mary of Egypt:

> "I am pretty convinced that the medieval viewer, looking at a hirsute Mary Magdalene, most likely saw her as a **Wild Woman**!"

The Wild Men and Wild Women (Wildweibchen) were a distinct iconographic tradition — hairy, self-sufficient humans in the wilderness. The [Met Museum](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/364585) holds Master ES's "Wild Woman with Unicorn" — combining lust (Wild Woman) and chastity (Unicorn) in one paradoxical image.

In medieval art, Wild Men "symbolised **sinful humanity**" — exactly what we'd expect if the Church sought to demonize a population it intended to eliminate. Łanuszka notes that "hirsute Magdalene disappeared from Western art around the same time when Wild Men lost their popularity" — the iconographic tradition vanished because the living memory of actual hairy humans was extinguished.

## The Pregnant Hairy Woman Fleeing the Census

No census in history has required pregnant women to travel. Mary was not traveling *to* the census — she was **fleeing** it. The census targeted her kind: hairy giants from Rus'. In 15th-century Netherlandish paintings, Magdalene appears in **unlaced maternity dresses** — the period's signal for pregnancy. In Rogier van der Weyden's *Descent from the Cross* (Prado, Madrid), [Magdalene wears a belt inscribed **"JHESUS MARIA"**](https://en.posztukiwania.pl/2014/07/22/pregnant-mary-magdalene/) — as if the unborn child bore the names of its parents.

Christ's father is conspicuously absent from every Gospel. The Church's "divine conception" may overlay a simpler reality: the father was almost certainly a victim of the same census-genocide, killed or captured before she arrived in Crimea. **Marriage as an institution was a creation of the same Deep State Church hunting her people.** Among the Wild People — self-sufficient, matrilineal, living outside State infrastructure — a Church-sanctioned union would have meant nothing.

## The Existential Threat: Matrilineal vs Patrilineal Religion

Christ's mother threatened the nascent Church because of her **lineage**. In the eastern Rus' tradition, religious heritage passed through the **mother** — the older matrilineal pattern preserved in Judaism and countless pre-Christian traditions. The Church was building a **patriarchal religion** where authority flowed from God the Father, to Christ the Son, to male apostles, to male priests. A prominent female figure passing down religious authority through the maternal line collapsed the Church's claim.

The Church's solution: conflate all the Marys into one domesticated Virgin; split off the threatening aspects into a separate sinful penitent; and eliminate the Wild People — removing the living evidence of the old matrilineal tradition.

## The Trojan War: A War Over the "Woman"

Per [Fomenko's reconstruction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03.html), the Bible and medieval chronicles used "wives" to represent **religions**: "the cause of the Trojan = Tarquinian = Gothic war could have been a **RELIGIOUS DISPUTE**: whose 'wife' was better." The "woman" at the centre of the Trojan War was Mary — the Mother of God, the religious tradition of Rus'. The conflict was between the Eastern/matrilineal tradition and the Western/patrilineal Deep State priesthood. The "abduction of Helen" was the Church's appropriation of Mary's story.

The hairy giants were dangerous because they were **self-sufficient** — they could live without buildings, money, or Church infrastructure. Christ's mother, fleeing the census with her unborn child, represented the last iteration of an older humanity that threatened the patriarchal church simply by existing.
