# The Revolution Survives Despite Christ's Martyrdom

The real reason for the survival of the Christian revolution was not a supernatural resurrection -- it was that Christ
himself walked away from Jerusalem alive. He returned home from Istanbul to Crimea carrying his brother Isukiri's body,
and the Christian congregation of smaller-sized humans followed. His influence began to rapidly spread.

## Two Branches of Christianity

Following the crucifixion, [two branches of Christianity](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_06.html) emerged.
The first, which Fomenko calls "Royal" or "Ancestral" Christianity, was the religion of the *relatives* of
Andronicus-Christ -- the royal family, the Empire's ruling clan. They regarded Christ as God, but also regarded
their own persons as holy, since God was their relation. This is the Christianity reflected in 'ancient' Egyptian
artifacts (Osiris = Christ, Set = his enemy, Isis = his mother) and the Greek Olympic pantheon (Zeus = Christ). The
gods fought among themselves but never forgot they were all divine -- vastly different from ordinary mortals.

The second branch was the **Apostolic Church** -- the Christianity of Christ's disciples, common people who had no
royal blood. This was a people's movement. The Apostolic Christians refused to venerate the living emperors as gods,
and many became the first Christian martyrs. Modern Christianity specifically calls itself the "Apostolic Church" --
a designation that only makes sense if, at some point, there existed *another* Church it needed to distinguish itself
from.

The tension between these two branches -- Royal Christianity (which would yield Judaism, with its skeptical view of
Christ) and Apostolic Christianity (which would become Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and later Islam) -- is the central
religious conflict of the next several centuries.

## The Foundations of the Rus-Horde Empire

The foundations were laid for a new republic in defiance of the religious authoritarianism practiced in Istanbul. This
new **Russian-Hordian** Empire would rapidly grow into a world empire until its dissolution in 1775. After the fall,
the memory of the founding of the Rus-Horde Empire would become *redacted* into other narratives -- the founding of
Medina by Muhammad after his flight from Mecca, the founding of "ancient Rome" by Romulus after the death of Remus,
and many others. [More: The Second Rome. Yoros = Jerusalem = Troy](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02.html)

## The Deep State's Trap

The Deep State had a secondary motive in allowing Christ to return alive to a homeland full of Giants. They were hoping
to trigger a revenge attack and route the giants into a trap. The tall walls of Jerusalem/Troy in Istanbul were built
specifically on the strategic Bosphorus river to fend off Giants. If one wall were to fall, there were 2 more within.
If the Deep State could trigger a *crusade* against the walls of Jerusalem, they would be able to eliminate a maximum
number of Giants in a single event.
