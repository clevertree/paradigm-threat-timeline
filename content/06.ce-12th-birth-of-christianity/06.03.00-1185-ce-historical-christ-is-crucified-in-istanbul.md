# Historical Christ is Crucified in Istanbul

With the planetary orbits stable for over a hundred years, it was now possible for the first time to predict future
eclipses. The date and time of the crucifixion was purposefully chosen on a solar eclipse to magnify the psychological
impact of the event. To the medieval mind it meant that God passed over the judgment and did not intervene to save
someone claiming to be his Son. This lie sufficed and his followers scattered in fear. The crucifixion of Christ was
designed to end the influence of Giants like Christ by allowing the smaller humans to poke, stab, and laugh at the
giants with impunity while they were bound to the crosses.

## The Site: Yoros = Jerusalem = Golgotha

The crucifixion took place on Beykoz mountain, on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus, near the fortress of
[Yoros](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02.html) -- an abbreviation of Ierosalim (Jerusalem). This fortress
controlled the narrowest part of the Bosphorus close to the entrance to the Black Sea. To this day, an enormous fenced
plot (approximately 3 by 17 metres) is known as the "grave of Yusha (Jesus)" -- not a real grave, but a memorial
marking the site of the crucifixion. For a full account of Yoros as First Jerusalem, see
[Deep State Centralize World Religion at Jerusalem](/content/05.ce-11th-common-era-begins/05.03.00-deep-state-centralize-world-religion-at-jerusalem.md).

It is notable that in many paintings, icons and frescoes, Christ's crucifixion is shown with a background of a *big
sea strait or a wide river* -- not an open sea. Artists with an accurate recollection of the original story would have
depicted the Bosphorus strait as a significant part of the landscape, as Beykoz mountain sits right on the shore with
a clear view of the European shore where the center of Constantinople is situated.

## The Turin Shroud: Physical Evidence

The most significant physical evidence for the 1185 dating is the
[Turin Shroud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin). In 1998, radiocarbon dating was performed by three
independent laboratories -- Oxford University, Arizona State University, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(Zurich). The result: *approximately the XI-XII centuries*. Fomenko
[argues](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_06.html) the most probable date is the second half of the XII century,
which corresponds precisely with the 1185 crucifixion. The body of Christ was wrapped in the Shroud, which then found
its way to Russia, where it was folded so that only the Holy Face was visible -- becoming the icon known as the
Image of the Savior Not-Made-By-Hands, used as a military banner by Yaroslavl, Tver' and Moscow princes. The Shroud
reached Turin only in the XVII century, after the fall of the Great Empire, when formerly seized relics could be
displayed without fear that the Horde would reclaim them.
