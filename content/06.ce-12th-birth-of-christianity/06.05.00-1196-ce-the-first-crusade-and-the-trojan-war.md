# The First Crusade and the Trojan War

## Revenge for the Crucifixion (1196 CE)

The *plan* works as intended as the humiliation of the crucifixion triggered a violent reaction especially in the
gathering Rus-Horde. Within 11 years, the Russians launched the First Crusade to capture the 'Holy Sepulcher' and take
revenge upon the crucifiers of Christ.

Fomenko [notes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02.html) that medieval Church sources assert *"immediately
after Jesus' Resurrection, Caesar's army went on a Crusade to Jerusalem and seized it"* -- a claim Scaligerian
historians dismiss as "vapid medieval conjecture" because no Roman Crusade occurred in the first century. But in the
New Chronology, the sources are literally correct: they describe the Crusades of the late XII -- early XIII centuries.
The start of the so-called First Crusade, today erroneously dated to 1096, is correctly dated to approximately 1196.
Fomenko emphasizes: *"in the end of the XI century the Crusaders were convinced that they were avenging not the
descendants of the Savior's executioners, but these executioners themselves."*

Not all Giants agreed with the Revenge Crusade. The older, wiser giants knew it was an obvious trap, and that two wrongs
*did not make a right*. However, the younger giants (up to 40 years old) were rash and began marching as soon as they
had the numbers. This first wave (remembered as
the [Children's Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade) in the 13th century) fell for the trap and
were killed or sold into slavery. After this failure, the older giants got involved and drew more cautious plans to take
the Holy Sepulcher and end the war.

## The Trojan War

The *Revenge Crusade* eventually turned religious as a new religion was forming around Christ and his mother Mary
(Katya). On the Trojan side, the ancient Deep State Bacchic goddess Aphrodite was worshiped. For this reason it is
remembered that the Trojan War was triggered over a woman. A decade of fighting ensued which saw the death of many
giants. The [Iliad](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/17439/what-does-branch-of-ares-mean-in-book-ii-of-the-iliad)
traces the lineage of some giants back to planet Mars where the [Jotunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn)
originated.

## The First Great War Between Giants and Smaller Humans

This was the first great war between human giants representing the Polytheistic 'Royal' bloodline Christianity descending
back to Christ and the 'Apostolic' Monotheistic Christianity of the normal-sized humans. The war concludes in the Battle
of Troy/Jerusalem/TsarGrad with the giant humans winning. The story goes -- the giants (Greeks) were having no luck
breaching the walls of TsarGrad (Troy), so they constructed a giant-sized wooden horse as tribute and pretended to flee
back to their homeland in Tartaria. The 'Trojans' brought the horse inside their walls seeing no threat, as the giants
could not possibly be hiding within, and they could not imagine that the giants had already gained the confidence of
the smaller humans to such a degree that the smaller humans would be willing to die on behalf of the giants in this
governance/war *against* giants -- but such willing and avenging behavior was the direct result of the Crucifixion of
Christ.
