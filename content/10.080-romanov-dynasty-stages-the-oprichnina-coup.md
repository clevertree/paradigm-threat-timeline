# The Oprichnina

The [Oprichnina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprichnina) (1564–1572) is conventionally described as a reign of
terror ordered by Ivan the Terrible against the Russian boyar nobility. The New Chronology of
[Fomenko and Nosovskiy](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html) inverts this picture entirely: the Oprichnina
was not Ivan's doing. It was a *dynastic coup* staged by the Zakharyins-Romanovs — relatives of Ivan's first wife
Anastasia — who seized Russia-Horde's government from the inside while the legitimate czar-khan was incapacitated,
and then used the state apparatus to annihilate their Hordian rivals.

*The oprichnina was a state policy implemented nominally by Ivan the Terrible between 1565 and 1572. Per New Chronology, the actual authors were the Zakharyins-Romanovs, who ruled on behalf of an infant czar and used the apparatus to exterminate the Hordian military elite.*

## The Four Ivans

The foundational claim of the New Chronology for this period is that **"Ivan the Terrible" is not one man** but a
composite of four distinct czar-khans whose reigns were later fused by Romanov historians to obscure the coup:

| Czar | Reign (NC) | Key Fact |
|---|---|---|
| **Ivan IV Vasilyevich** | 1547–1553 | Conquered Kazan 1552; fell gravely ill 1553, became Vasiliy the Blessed (holy fool) |
| **Dmitry Ivanovich** | 1553–1563 | Infant son; ruled by the council *Izbrannaya Rada* (Adashev); began the Livonian War |
| **Ivan V Ivanovich** | 1563–1572 | Young son; real power held by Zakharyins-Romanovs — the Oprichnina is unleashed in his name |
| **Simeon-Ivan Beckbulatovitch** | 1572–1584 | Hordian Khan; restored after the Horde defeated the Zakharyin faction |

The historians' version — one czar with 50 years of reign, six wives, and decades of erratic behavior — is a
Romanov-era construction designed to attribute all blame for the terror to a single "terrible" monarch, and to
conceal the Romanovs' own role in the killings.

## Ivan IV Falls Ill — The Coup Begins

In 1553 Ivan IV (Vasilyevich) was struck by severe illness and effectively lost his faculties. He is the same
person known to the Russian Orthodox Church as *Vasiliy the Blessed*, the famous Moscow holy fool. When his infant
son Dmitry Ivanovich acceded, a council (*Izbrannaya Rada*) led by Adashev governed on the child's behalf. The
Livonian War — the Empire's planned punitive campaign to crush the Western Reformation — was launched.

In 1563, adolescent Dmitry died in an accident. His younger brother, **infant Ivan V Ivanovich**, became czar.
This is the moment the Zakharyins-Romanovs moved decisively.

> *"From his enthronement the Zakharyins-Romanovs regain power and begin the terror."*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 6

The pro-Western faction of the Zakharyins — **related to Ivan's first wife Anastasia Romanova** — now controlled
the court in the name of the child czar. They immediately sabotaged the ongoing Livonian War campaign against the
Western Reformation, halting the Empire's most critical military operation. The boyar **V.M. Yuriev-Zakharyin**
was one of the principal organizers of the oprichnina structure itself.

## The Livonian War: A Reformation Suppressed

Before the coup, Russia-Horde had crushed the **Kazan Rebellion** (1552) — a secession attempt by the Kazan
Khanate, which had converted to Judaism and sought independence from the Empire. This victory is encoded in
Herodotus as *Cambyses' conquest of Memphis* and in *Xerxes' bridge across the Hellespont*. With Kazan subdued,
the Empire turned west: the **Livonian War** was the planned third conquest of Europe — a punitive campaign against
the Protestant Reformation which threatened the Empire's religious and political unity.

In the Romanov version, "Livonia" is shrunk to the small Baltic region; in reality, the entire rebelling Western
Europe was called Livonia. The campaign was poised to crush the Reformation root and branch. The
Zakharyin-Romanov coup sabotaged it permanently.

## The Terror: 1564–1572

The main stages of the Oprichnina terror as it actually unfolded:

- **1564** — The Oprichnina is formally established. The Zakharyins-Romanovs set up a parallel state apparatus.
- **1565** — Mass deportation from Kazan.
- **1568** — Mass executions of boyars. Chronicle-writing in *Zemshchina* ceases entirely. The chroniclers themselves are killed: *"The print worker Ivan Viskovati was executed… fear prevented any attempts to restore the writing of the chronicles."*
- **1569–1570** — **The crushing defeat of Veliky Novgorod = Yaroslavl.** The old Hordian capital on the Volga was completely destroyed and its entire population banished. This is the single most consequential act of the Oprichnina — the deliberate erasure of the Horde dynasty's power base and the destruction of its historical records.
- **1569** — Murder of Metropolitan Philip and Archbishop of Kazan Gherman.
- **1570** — Execution of Prince Vladimir Andreyevich Staritsky, a member of the royal dynasty with a legitimate claim to the Hordian throne.

> *"The new people came to power — the Zakharyins (the Skharievtsy), the future Romanovs. They wished to distort the Russian history in such a way that the origins of the old Horde dynasty from Yaroslavl were concealed."*
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, Ch. 6

The name "Veliky Novgorod" was stripped from Yaroslavl and transferred to a small settlement in the Pskov swamps —
the town now known as Novgorod-on-Volkhov. The Romanovs' own domain was in north-western Russia, and they rewrote
geography and dates to make the dynasty appear to originate there.

## The Esther-Judith Parallel

The New Chronology identifies the Oprichnina as the historical original of the **biblical Books of Esther and
Judith**. Both describe a coup carried out "via a woman" — a foreign heretic who infiltrates the Persian/Assyrian
court, gains the king's favor, and engineers the massacre of the ruling military class (the "Persians").

- **Esther** = a Hebrewess at the court of King Artaxerxes; the massacre of Persians follows; **Purim** is
  established to commemorate it.
- **Judith** = a Jewish widow who decapitates the Assyrian general Holofernes; the Assyrian army (= Russia-Horde's
  punitive western campaign) collapses.

In the Russian version of the XVI century, the role of Esther is played by **Marfa Sobakina**, Ivan's third wife —
a foreigner whose death prompted Ivan's ecclesiastical penance, exactly as Ivan III's penance followed the death
of Elena Voloshanka in the duplicate XV-century version.

The holiday of **Purim** itself, in the New Chronology, commemorates the massacre of the Hordian nobility during
the Oprichnina. The "Persians" who were slaughtered = the Russian-Hordian boyar class.

## The Horde Counterattack

The Zakharyins did not hold power unchallenged. The Hordian army — recorded by Romanov historians as the
*"Crimean Khan's invasion"* — struck back. In 1571, the Horde approached Moscow and burned it. The nominal czar
**"abandoned his army and fled to Rostov"**. Shortly before, in 1569, he had requested political asylum in England
— anticipating the reversal.

The Horde prevailed. The famous "Moscow affair" begins:

- The leaders of the *Zakharyin oprichnina* — including Basmanov — were executed.
- A new Duma was constituted from noble families who had *survived* the Zakharyin terror.
- **Malyuta Skuratov-Belsky** is conventionally depicted as Ivan the Terrible's most feared enforcer. In the New
  Chronology he was a *Hordian* officer who hunted down the Zakharyin oprichnina's leadership after the counterattack:
  *"Skuratov helped Ivan the Terrible to dispose of the old guard oprichniks — i.e. the Zakharyin's guard."*

In 1572, **Ivan V Ivanovich was forced to abdicate**. The Hordian khan **Simeon Beckbulatovitch** — most likely
the youngest son of Ivan III — was crowned czar under the name Ivan. The capital temporarily returned to
Yaroslavl-Novgorod while Moscow was rebuilt.

## Romanov Falsification of the Record

Once the Romanovs permanently seized the throne in the XVII century, they undertook a systematic revision of the
previous century's history:

1. **Merged four czars into one** — attributing all reigns and all crimes to "Ivan the Terrible" with a 50-year
   reign, making the coup invisible.
2. **Erased the Zakharyin role in the terror** — dumping all blame on the composite "Terrible Czar."
3. **Geographic falsification** — stripped the name "Veliky Novgorod" from Yaroslavl-on-Volga and assigned it to
   their own north-western homeland.
4. **Suppressed the Esther/Judith narrative** — the story of the coup "via a woman" was dangerous because it
   directly implicated Anastasia Romanova's family in the heresy of the Judaizers and the dynastic coup.
5. **Declared the Horde dynasty illegitimate** — rebranding three centuries of Russian-Hordian rule as a "foreign
   Tatar yoke" from which the Romanovs had "liberated" Russia.

The cessation of chronicle writing after 1568 was not incidental. The people recording history were physically
exterminated during the Novgorod pogrom. What survives of pre-Romanov Russian history was either reinterpreted,
redated, or fabricated after the fact.
