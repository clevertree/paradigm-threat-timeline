# Romanov Dynasty stages "The Oprichnina" coup

The oppression known as the [Oprichnina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprichnina) began when Czar-khan Ivan 'the
terrible' IV fell ill and retired to the monastery effectively abdicating the throne. The relatives of the Czar,
the [Zakharyins-Romanovs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Romanovich_Zakharyin-Yuriev) staged a coup taking over the
court and assumed ruler-ship of the kingdom. They subsequently ordered the assassination of the Hordian elite and military
commanders including the legitimate heirs to the throne. This event marks the beginning of the *darkest period* in Russian history.
