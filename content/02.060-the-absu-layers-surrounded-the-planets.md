# The Absu layers surrounded the Planets

Visible on the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth was "[the Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php)", also called
"The Abyss" or [Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament) in the Christian Bible. This 'seal' represented multiple outer layers of Saturn's plasma sheath and appeared
to humans as obscuring equatorial rings of a cosmic 'sea' in the southern sky.
[Jno Cook](https://jnocook.net/) describes it:

> "I had no trouble identifying the Sumerian Absu, the Egyptian Duat,
> and the Maya House of Nine Bushes as a set of rings seen in the southern night sky.
> The rings were almost universally, throughout the world, understood to be an
> ocean standing up from the south horizon. By the Talbott / Thornhill model,
> Earth would have existed within the glow level plasma discharge (the coronal envelope)
> of Saturn before the intersection with the Solar System, and within the memory of mankind.
> The stars and other planets might not have been visible, and perhaps not even Saturn would have been seen
> — just the 'waters above'."
