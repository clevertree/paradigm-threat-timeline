# Hundred Years' War ends — Fall of Czar-Grad (1453 CE)

In **1453 CE**, Mehmed II's forces took Czar-Grad (Constantinople), the seat of the Eastern Roman Empire —
an event chronologia.org's New Chronology (Chapter 5 §14) identifies as the true chronological anchor of the
Biblical Exodus epoch and the effective close of a century-long western campaign against the Horde. The
conventional "Hundred Years' War" (1337–1453) terminates on this same date, and the Deep State took the fall
of the city as proof that direct westward military conquest of Europe had reached its limit.

The Deep State learned that they could not simply conquer Europe by force. It was also obvious that any attempt by the
Empire to spread propaganda or religion West would be met with the same resistance. There was only one solution left —
flip the script and **invade** the Rus-Horde Empire from the West!
