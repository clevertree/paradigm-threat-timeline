# European Religious Schism Emerges

Within the Great Empire of the 14th century, a profound religious fault-line ran between two forms of Christianity:
**Royal (Hereditary) Christianity** — the older dynastic faith of the czar-khans — and the emerging **Apostles'
Christianity**, a reformed popular faith that culminated in the [Battle of Kulikovo (~1370–1380)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kulikovo).
Fomenko and Nosovskiy identify this conflict as the same event recorded in Roman sources as Constantine the Great's
victory over Maxentius, and in the Old Testament as David and Goliath. **Dmitry Donskoi = Constantine I** baptised
the entire Horde Empire into Apostles' Christianity by the end of the 14th century.

The Deep State learned during the Crusade that it can exploit religious schisms to trigger a war, and set upon
achieving the *next one*. As it operated behind the scenes in the new Kremlin capitol, it also
**controlled the opposition** by giving orders to scattered priesthoods in Western Europe to resist the Empire and
preserve Monotheism. In defiance of Christianity, Western Europe continued to
[practice in secret](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sephardim#3) the Monotheistic religion of the Deep State. In
public, they engaged in unlawful [Dionysian orgy ceremonies](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html). The
Rus-Horde Officials were dumbfounded by this *heretical* behavior. They watched western *pagans* commit sacrifice
rituals and attempted to communicate and take orders from [invisible spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn).
In the next 2 centuries the local populations would start publicly
[burning heretics at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_burned_as_heretics) leading the Rus-Horde
empire to begin an [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) to find a peaceful solution.

The schism had a structural dimension too: Ivan Kalita (= Batu Khan) had, upon founding the Vatican, left behind
**two branches of government** — the czarist branch in Russia and the papal branch in Italy. These two branches
fought for supremacy long after his death. Western Europe's resistance to the Horde was therefore both religious
*and* political: newly minted "ancient" histories were composed in the 17th–18th centuries to erase all memory
of the Russian presence, including the deliberate suppression of Slavonic readings of Etruscan inscriptions
and the relocation of "Novgorod" from Yaroslavl-on-Volga to an obscure swampy site on the Volkhov River.

*In this illustrated [manuscript](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361166387_Plague_and_Popular_Revival_Ecclesiastical_Authorities_and_the_Bianchi_Devotions_in_1399/fulltext/63639dc5431b1f5300688acd/Plague-and-Popular-Revival-Ecclesiastical-Authorities-and-the-Bianchi-Devotions-in-1399.pdf) painted in Tuscany at the end of the 14th Century, devils shoot down arrows to inflict horror upon a tangled mass of humanity. Religious processions were commonly held during plague outbreaks in medieval Europe to provide succour against disease. During the Black Death of 1347–52, for example, a flagellant revival occurred, although this was condemned by church authorities as it descended into anti-clerical violence.*
