# Cossack–Polish War begins ethnic cleansing of Russians in Ukraine

[Pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom#Historical_background) against anyone associated with the old Empire
(particularly Jews and Poles) became increasingly commonplace leading up to
the [Khmelnytsky Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising) started by
Jesuit [Bohdan Khmelnytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising). Historians estimate anywhere
from 40, 000 to 100, 000 men, women and children (or perhaps more) were murdered by Cossacks.

## The Razin Uprising: The Same War Under a Different Name

The Khmelnytsky Uprising was not an isolated event but part of a continuous resistance campaign that the Romanov historians have carefully fragmented into unrelated "uprisings" and "revolts." The Stenka Razin Uprising of 1670–71, centered in Astrakhan and the lower Volga — the old heart of Hordian territory — is the clearest continuation. Razin's army swept through the Volga region, defeating Romanov forces repeatedly before being captured and executed in Moscow in 1671. The Romanov narrative frames this as a Cossack peasant revolt. In the NC framework it was the Hordian military structure reasserting itself against the foreign dynasty.

The geography is telling: Astrakhan, Razin's base, was one of the last explicitly Hordian strongholds. Its population still identified with Cossack-Hordian governance rather than the Romanov Petersburg model. The Volga corridor — from Nizhny Novgorod to the Caspian — was the border zone between Romanov Russia and the vast territory still known on Western maps as **Moscow Tartary**.

## Moscow Tartary: The Horde's Last Stronghold

By the mid-17th century, Western European cartographers recognized two distinct Russian states: Romanov Russia, centered on Moscow and Petersburg, and the far larger **Moscow Tartary** — which, according to the 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica, *"was the largest country in the world"*. Moscow Tartary stretched from the Volga (with the border near Nizhny Novgorod, close to Moscow itself) across the Urals, Siberia, Central Asia, the Far East, Alaska, and North American territories west of the frontier settlements.

The capital of Moscow Tartary was Tobolsk — identified in the Bible as Tubal, alongside Ros (Russia) and Meshekh (Moscow). The Hordian czar of Tobolsk considered the Romanovs of Petersburg to be illegitimate usurpers of the Western portion of his domain. This political reality — of two competing Russian governments, one the Romanov puppet state and one the surviving Hordian structure — explains the continuous string of "peasant rebellions" in the 17th and 18th centuries: they were not peasant revolts but wars between these two states. The Romanovs systematically concealed the existence of their Siberian rival, treating it as a national secret enforced by the [Secret Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_chancery).
