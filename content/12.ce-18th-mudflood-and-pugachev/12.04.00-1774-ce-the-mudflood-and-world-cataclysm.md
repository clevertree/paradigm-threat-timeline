# The MudFlood and World Cataclysm

The *MudFlood Energetic Event* (MFEE) describes a planet-scale calamity that struck the Earth in the late 18th century, abruptly and permanently raising ground levels around existing cathedrals, pyramids, and monuments — burying entire civilizations in mud. Photographs, excavation reports, and comparative maps all document cities buried without satisfactory mainstream explanation: no tilting from liquefaction, no debris consistent with hydraulic drilling, no gradual accumulation. The event appears to have been simultaneous and worldwide.

According to the MFEE Hypothesis, the trigger was the [Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) of 1773–1774 — the final war between the *Royal* Christian giants descended from Christ and the Romanov-backed forces of the smaller humans. The Romanov state, unable to defeat Pugachev's army by conventional means, called upon a breakaway human civilization on Mars to deploy large-scale [Directed Energy Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_weapon) against all remaining strongholds loyal to the Rus-Tartarian empire. The secondary discharge backfired, devastating Martian surface cities as well.

The energy event coursed across the Earth's surface, tearing up land and hurling matter miles into the air. Positive electric discharge pulled entire mountain ranges from the ground in dendritic patterns; negative discharge carved canyons identical to the lightning scarring observed across Mars. This process also explains the instantaneous petrification of human giants — who had no shelter large enough to survive — producing what later archaeologists catalogued as *dinosaur fossil graveyards*.

World maps dated before the 19th century record a dramatically different Earth: California appears as an island larger than the United Kingdom, the Grand Canyon and Colorado River are absent, and no Himalayan mountain range is shown. Old maps of Siberia depict a flourishing Tartarian empire with cities, rivers, and natural boundaries — nothing resembling the uninhabitable wasteland it became after the event. To find where the melted Tartarian cities once stood, search a modern map of global gold mine concentrations — the correlation is striking.

The emptied cities were subsequently repopulated via orphan trains, their new inhabitants forming the first cargo cults. The surviving indigenous peoples — the so-called "Red-Skin" Native Americans, direct relatives of the Lamanites — were hunted and relocated across the Bering Strait (the Trail of Tears), after which the Bering Strait itself was destroyed. The Smithsonian Institution, founded in 1846, systematically excavated and suppressed giant skeletal remains across America, reclassifying them as dinosaur fossils and establishing the false narrative that indigenous Americans were Stone Age cave dwellers.

The cover-up was completed through a coordinated redaction of all history, religion, science, and language, imposed by those who controlled the repopulation. World religions were *canonized* — the Latin word *canon* meaning both "authority" and a large gun — by the same military force that carried out the event. The ability to erase the past gives those in the present control of the future: all that remained was the managed story, the managed map, and the managed bones.
