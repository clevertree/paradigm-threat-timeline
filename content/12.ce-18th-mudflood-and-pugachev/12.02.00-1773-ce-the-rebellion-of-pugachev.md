# The Rebellion of Pugachev

In 1774, Pugachev's rebellion reached a peak, and claiming to be Peter III and a direct descendant of Christ,
Pugachev was in a position to claim rulership of the *entire Tartarian Empire* and overthrow the foreign House of
Romanov that had ruled the empire since the Oprichnina. Had this happened, Pugachev would have been in a position to
smash the Western European Reformation/Renaissance that threatened the Tartarian empire for so long.
Had he accomplished that, the Russian Tartarian Empire could have returned to its former glory with a vengeance
re-conquering the entire world, and imposing upon it a Second Inquisition that would have erased the
Reformation/Renaissance and Monotheism, and along with them, slavery, usury, and everything else in Pandora's Box.

Pugachev was a giant human, as were much of his army.
He was also Peter the 3rd - Descendant of Christ and actual heir to the Russian throne.
He was not an imposter as the Romanov historians say.
For this reason, he was leading a rebellion of both giants and smaller-sized humans
against the authority of the Romanovs who had seized control of the empire during the bloody Oprichnina.
He was, as the giants always were, the biggest threat to the Church and its doctrine.
This was the 3rd major war between humans and giants.
The first was the Crusade of the early 12th century (See [history/chronology](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/history/chronology)).
The 2nd was the battle of Kulikovo (1380) where the giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology
of the smaller humans. In this battle, 'Royal' christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today
(Canonization). However, in Pugachev's time, giants had their own cannons and were masters of 'guerrilla' warfare.
His rebellion was seen as a threat to all the military religious orders of the world, who were just as likely to
join Pugachev as to fight against him.

## Moscow Tartary: The War's True Stakes

The NC framework places Pugachev's rebellion in its proper geopolitical context. At the time of the conflict (1773–1775), Moscow Tartary still existed as a functional sovereign state — acknowledged by Western cartographers who labeled it the largest country in the world in the 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica. Its capital was Tobolsk (the Biblical Tubal, alongside Ros/Russia and Meshekh/Moscow). Its territory extended from the Volga (near Nizhny Novgorod, dangerously close to Moscow) across the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, Alaska, and the North American continent west of the Atlantic coastal settlements.

The "rebellion" was not a peasant uprising — it was a war between two Russian states. The Tobolsk czar (identified in the NC framework as the legitimate Hordian ruler, with Pugachev as either his military commander or the czar himself) launched an offensive against Romanov Russia from the east, simultaneously with the Ottoman Empire attacking from the south. The Romanovs, fighting on two fronts, were in genuine danger of collapse. Fomenko writes:

> *"The conflict between Moscow Tartary and Romanov Russia (originally small in size) ended in the second half of the XVIII century with the famous, allegedly 'peasant', war against 'Pugachev'. The Romanovs succeeded in agreeing peace separately with Turkey and defeating the Great Tartary."*
— Fomenko, [Ch.8 §1](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html)

## Suvorov Defeated Pugachev — and This Was Concealed

One of the most remarkable revelations in the NC reconstruction concerns the actual commander who defeated Pugachev. Official Russian history attributes the victory to the obscure Lieutenant-Colonel Mikhailson. Fomenko's analysis demonstrates that it was in fact **Alexander Suvorov** — the greatest Russian military commander of the century — who personally led the decisive campaign, conveyed "Pugachev" to Simbirsk, and received the most extravagant awards of his career for doing so.

The concealment was deliberate: after the war, the Romanovs needed to present the conflict as a minor peasant disturbance suppressed by routine forces — not a massive military campaign requiring their finest general. Suvorov's famous title "Count of Rymnik" (awarded for a supposed 1789 battle in Romania) is traced by Fomenko to the real battle fought on the Yaik/Rymnik River against Pugachev in 1774. A Romanian river was later renamed "Rymnik" specifically to provide a plausible alternative explanation for Suvorov's title:

> *"It turns out that A.V.Suvorov's distinguished title of 'Count of Rymnik' is not related to the geographical name of 'Rymnik' in Romania... but to the old name of the Yaik River (at present the Ural River)... This factor radically changes the traditional belief about A.V.Suvorov's participation in the Pugachev War. It turns out that it was he who defeated Pugachev."*
— Fomenko, [Ch.8 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html)

## The USA and the Partition of Moscow Tartary

The timing of the American Declaration of Independence (1776) relative to the defeat of Pugachev (1775) is not coincidental. The American colonies were fighting the [War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) on the Atlantic coast in the same years that the last Hordian state was collapsing in Siberia. In the NC framework:

> *"'During the War of independence of North America in 1775-1783… an independent state – the USA was formed.' And here we realise, that it SURPRISINGLY COINCIDES WITH THE END OF THE WAR WITH 'PUGACHEV' IN RUSSIA. 'Pugachev' was crushed in 1775... 'The War of independence' in North America was the struggle with the weakening Russian Horde. The Romanovs attacked the Horde from the West. And from the East in America — it was attacked by the Americans 'fighting for independence'."*
— Fomenko, [Ch.8 §1](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html)

With Pugachev defeated, the Romanovs and the new United States divided the territories of Moscow Tartary between them: the Romanovs took the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East; the Americans moved west across the North American continent. Alaska, the last Hordian territory in America, was only transferred directly to the USA in 1867 — after the Romanovs concluded they could not realistically maintain it against American expansion. Hollywood's mythology of heroic frontiersmen versus savage Indians is, in this framework, the American cover story for the military conquest of the territory of a state that had once been the largest in the world.
