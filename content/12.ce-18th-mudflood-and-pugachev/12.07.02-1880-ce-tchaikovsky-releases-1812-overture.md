# Tchaikovsky releases 1812 Overture

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed the [1812 Overture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_Overture) (*Торжественная увертюра «1812 год»*) in 1880, commissioned for the consecration of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow — itself built to commemorate Russia's victory over Napoleon. Its premiere featured live cannon fire, church bells, and massed military bands. Today it remains one of the most performed orchestral works in the world, its climax inseparable from the image of fireworks and artillery.

What Tchaikovsky encoded in its structure is significant: the overture opens not with a Russian nationalist fanfare but with **the Russian Orthodox hymn** *God Preserve Thy People*, drawn from the ancient Kievan liturgical tradition — the music of the old Hordian spiritual world. This is pitted against the *Marseillaise* (the French Revolutionary anthem) and ultimately overwhelmed by cannon blasts and church bells. The thematic contest is between two visions of civilization: the old Orthodox-Imperial order and the new Financial-Republican order that Napoleon had carried across Europe.

## The Geopolitical Context: America, France, and the Battle for Financial Sovereignty

The decades preceding Napoleon's invasion were defined by a single global contest: who would control the financial architecture of the post-Hordian world — the City of London's debt-based banking empire, or any remaining configuration of state sovereignty?

In the United States, [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton) and the Federalists had already answered this question by choosing alignment with London. Having convinced the Washington administration to assume national and state debts, pass tax laws, and create a central bank linked with England, the Federalists locked the new American republic into the same financial architecture that had destroyed every independent gold-based monetary system in Europe. Anti-Federalist Republicans like Thomas Jefferson understood the stakes:

> *"Anti-Federalists such as Thomas Jefferson feared that a concentration of central authority might lead to a loss of individual and states rights. They resented Federalist monetary policies and favored France over England."*

France had charted a different course. In 1790, the Revolutionary government banned usury and canceled all Church taxes and institutional powers. For a brief period the French Republic was financially independent — and immediately became the target of every coalition that London could finance.

## Napoleon's Rise

Napoleon's path to power ran through precisely the military crisis that financial independence had caused:

- **1792–1797**: The First Coalition (Austria, Prussia, Britain, Spain) attempted to crush Revolutionary France
- **1793**: Royalist invasion forces were defeated at Toulon — granting nationwide fame to Napoleon Bonaparte
- **1797**: The Coalition defeated; Napoleon victorious in Italy and Egypt
- **1799**: Napoleon seizes power in the [Coup of 18 Brumaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_Brumaire) — ending the Directory government after it had been radicalized and hollowed out by the Jacobins
- **1804**: Napoleon becomes Emperor — completing the transition from Republic to Empire

Napoleon's [Egyptian campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria) (1798–1801) had an additional significance: it brought French scholars into direct contact with the ruins of the Hordian Imperial legacy that mainstream archaeology would later date to "antiquity." What the Rosetta Stone unlocked was not merely an ancient script but the evidence of a much more recent imperial history that the Scaligerian chronology had buried.

## Napoleon's Legacy for Jewish Emancipation

In defiance of the old religious order, Napoleon legally emancipated France's Jewish population and extended this policy across the Empire:

> *"By decree of Napoleon's government in 1797, the Inquisition in Venice was abolished in 1806."*

The Inquisition — the enforcement mechanism that had policed the boundary between the Christian and Jewish worlds for three centuries — was dismantled across Napoleonic Europe. In the NC framework, this represented the final unraveling of the institutional apparatus that the Reformation had used to control the remnants of the old Imperial treasury caste. After Napoleon, European Jews were legally citizens, not protected-but-subordinated guests of Christian kingdoms. The social question shifted from religious to economic.

## The Romanov-British Alliance and Napoleon's Defeat

Napoleon's defeat came from the same coalition that had carved up Moscow Tartary: the Romanov dynasty and the British financial empire. Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Britain — subsidized by Rothschild credit networks on all sides — provided the armies. The Romanov incentive was existential: if Napoleon succeeded in reorganizing Europe on the Napoleonic Code's property-rights basis, the serfs of the newly-conquered Siberian territories (ex-Moscow Tartary) might have found in him an ally. The scorched-earth campaign of 1812 was designed to ensure Napoleon found only ash.

The aftermath — the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna) (1815) — restored the European monarchies. But every restored throne was now indebted to the banking houses that had financed the wars, principally the Rothschild network. Political sovereignty was restored; financial sovereignty was not.

## The Jesuit Jerusalem Project

Parallel to the Napoleonic wars, the Jesuits were completing their final chronological project: the identification and institutionalization of Jerusalem's location. The raw notes for this article identify the **4th Israelites** as the Jesuits who sent pilgrims to find Jerusalem's ruins. Per the NC framework, the Jesuits *deliberately marked the wrong location on the map* — marching pilgrims past the actual ruins in Turkey (the original Constantinople/Czar-Grad location of Biblical Jerusalem) and founding Jerusalem III at [Al-Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) / Al-Quds in Palestine.

This purposeful redaction of Jerusalem's location became a *Jesuit test of faith*: to be a Christian, Muslim, or Jew, one must believe that the Palestinian location was always the original. The three Abrahamic faiths are thus anchored to a geography that the Jesuits chose in the 17th–19th centuries — with all the political consequences for the Middle East that this implies.

## Tchaikovsky's Musical Testament

Tchaikovsky composed the 1812 Overture sixty-eight years after the event it commemorated, and sixty-seven years after the Congress of Vienna had finalized the new order. By 1880, the old Hordian world was visible only in the Orthodox Church's liturgical music — the same music that opens his overture. The cannon fire that ends it is ambiguous: it represents both the Russian victory of 1812 and the gunpowder that had been used to blow up Cathar castles, demolish Hordian fortifications, and end the independence of every state that refused to capitulate to the new financial order.

In the NC reading, the 1812 Overture is the last great piece of *counter-historical* art: a musical argument that the old world, with its Orthodox Christianity, its Slavic spiritual roots, and its Imperial memory, was worth fighting for. By the time Tchaikovsky wrote it, that argument had already been lost.

Largely influenced by the ideas of Alexander Hamilton, the Federalists succeeded in convincing the Washington
administration to assume national and state debts, pass tax laws, and create a central bank linked with England. In
foreign policy, Federalists generally favored England over France. Anti-Federalists Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson
feared that a concentration of central authority might lead to a loss of individual and states rights. They resented
Federalist monetary policies and favored France over England.

Patrice Gueniffey: He was, I think, ultimately rather good [for the Jews], because his policies for the Jewish community
in France and the Empire promoted their assimilation into the French nation. The French revolution liberated the Jews
but did not assimilate them. Napoleon took up the case again and decided to do for the Jews what he had done for other
religions. The French Jewish community became Europe’s most assimilated during the 19th
century. https://forward.com/culture/319002/the-secret-jewish-history-of-napoleon-bonaparte/

original location of the Biblical Jerusalem.
