# Secret Society of Jesus goes public

By the early 18th century, the Jesuit Society of Jesus had been operating as a transnational covert organization for nearly two centuries — infiltrating courts, universities, missionary networks, and intelligence channels across every major civilization on Earth. The period of maximum secrecy had been necessary during the consolidation phase of the Reformation. Now, with the Hordian resistance in Russia effectively neutralized by the Romanovs, and the last fragments of Moscow Tartary not yet organized for a counter-attack, the Society moved into its more openly dominating phase.

The treaties of London (1718) and Vienna (1725) represented the formalization of this new order: a coordinated European colonial project that would divide the non-European world between a small number of Western powers, all operating under the theological and financial architecture the Jesuits and the new banking class had constructed. The `Society of Jesus` was the institutional spine connecting these treaty systems — providing the intelligence networks, the trained administrators, the missionaries-as-scouts, and the theological justification for conquest that no purely secular institution could have provided.

Per the Marfull chronological framework:

## The Jesuit Educational Empire

By the 18th century, the Jesuits had built the most extensive educational network in the world. At its peak, the Society operated over 800 universities, seminaries, and colleges across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. This was not an accident — it was the core of their operational strategy. Control the education of the ruling class and you control the next generation's worldview. Jesuit universities trained the diplomats, lawyers, military officers, and administrators who staffed the colonial bureaucracies of every European empire.

The educational network also served an intelligence function. Students who passed through Jesuit institutions became the Society's eyes and ears in every court, every parliament, and every colonial administration in the Western world. The Jesuits did not need spies; they had alumni.

## The 1773 Suppression: When the Tool Outgrew the Toolmaker

The most extraordinary event in 18th century Jesuit history was the Society's **suppression** by the very institution that had created it.

On July 21, 1773, Pope [Clement XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_XIV) issued the papal brief *[Dominus ac Redemptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominus_ac_Redemptor)*, dissolving the Society of Jesus worldwide. The suppression was demanded by the Bourbon monarchies of France, Spain, Portugal, and Naples — the same Catholic powers that the Jesuits had helped bring to dominance. The stated reason was that the Jesuits had become too politically powerful, too financially independent, and too willing to challenge royal authority. The real reason was simpler: the tool had outgrown the toolmaker.

The Jesuits had accumulated enormous wealth through their global network — plantations in the Americas, trading operations in Asia, real estate across Europe. They had their own intelligence channels that rivalled those of any nation-state. They answered to the Superior General in Rome, not to local monarchs. And they had begun to act independently: the [Guaraní Reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_reduction) in Paraguay were effectively an autonomous Jesuit state; the court astronomers in China served Rome's interests, not those of any European crown.

The suppression was carried out with varying degrees of brutality. In Portugal (1759), Jesuits were imprisoned or deported. In France (1764), their property was confiscated. In Spain (1767), over 5,000 Jesuits were expelled overnight. When Clement XIV signed the universal suppression in 1773, approximately 23,000 Jesuits worldwide were affected — their schools closed, their missions disbanded, their members secularized or transferred to other religious orders.

### The Russian Exception

The single most significant exception to the suppression was **Russia**. [Catherine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great) refused to publish the papal brief in her territories, allowing the Jesuits to continue operating in the Russian Empire — particularly in White Russia (modern Belarus). The irony is layered: the order created to help dismantle the Hordian world order found sanctuary in the successor state of that order, because the Romanov dynasty recognized the Jesuits' administrative and educational value.

This Russian haven kept the Society of Jesus alive during its forty-one years of official dissolution and became the nucleus from which the order was [restored in 1814](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.05.00-1814-ce-the-jesuit-restoration-and-the-missionary-military-pattern.md). The Jesuits who survived under Catherine's protection maintained their institutional knowledge, their training programmes, and their global networks — and emerged from the suppression period organizationally intact, ready for the 19th century explosion of missionary imperialism.

## The Paradox of the 18th Century Jesuits

The 18th century reveals the central paradox of the Jesuit story: an organization simultaneously serving imperial interests and being destroyed by those same interests when it became too effective.

The Jesuits were respectable. They genuinely educated millions. Their missionaries genuinely documented indigenous cultures with a care that no Protestant equivalent ever matched (see the comparison with Scaliger's chronological project in the [16th century article](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.02.00-1523-ce-jesuits-make-pilgrimage-to-palestine.md)). Individual Jesuits genuinely advocated for indigenous communities against colonial exploitation. But the system they served — the colonial-financial architecture built on Catholic monotheism, central banking, and the extraction of non-European resources — had never intended to produce an autonomous, conscience-bearing intelligence organization. It had intended to produce obedient operatives.

When the Jesuits began to develop independent judgment — questioning the slave trade, defending indigenous land rights, building autonomous communities in Paraguay, accumulating wealth outside royal control — the system that created them destroyed them. Temporarily. They would return stronger, and the [pattern would continue into the 19th century](/content/13.ce-19th-rise-of-communism/13.05.00-1814-ce-the-jesuit-restoration-and-the-missionary-military-pattern.md).
