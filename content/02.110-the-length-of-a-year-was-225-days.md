# The length of a year was 225 days

In this time Saturn was called [Kronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus), the *God before time began* and Creator
of the Universe (i.e. our solar system). Before clocks and calendars, the positions of the planets and stars were the
only way to tell time. Saturn's system was now orbiting our Sun, and with this apparent motion - time began. Our current
Sun was still hidden behind Saturn (and Jupiter) and was not yet visible to humans. As the spin of the Earth did not
change significantly from antiquity until modern times, so we can regard the length of a 'day' on Earth as a
constant. In this time the length of a year of orbit around the Sun was 225 days. This orbit was 40%
*faster* than our current orbit of 365.25 days. The changes of the length in the year occur periodically and suddenly in
history as the Earth jumps from one orbit to another, eventually reaching its individual orbit around the Sun. With each
jump, the Earth became part of a smaller configuration and drew in less energy from the Sun. This resulted in a
*slower* orbit.
