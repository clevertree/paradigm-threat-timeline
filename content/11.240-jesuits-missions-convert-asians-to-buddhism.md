# Jesuits Missions convert Asians to Buddhism

`TODO: this section needs revision`

The success of the Jesuit missions in Europe, Africa, and America emboldened the Jesuits to target the last
remaining non-monotheistic indigenous religion left in the world-*Christianity*. In Western Europe, the Jesuits had
already *catharized* anyone associated with original Gnostic Christianity, but the Missionaries knew Asia would be more
difficult to conquer theologically and militarily.

The Jesuit mission to convert eastern *Gnostic* Christians into western Catholicism proved impossible. Any attempt to
proselytize Gnostics into the belief that Christ was the only *Son* of the *Creator God of the Universe* was met with
skepticism. Eastern Christians already had detailed records of Christ-their first Emperor and founder of the Rus-Horde
Empire-spanning hundreds of years after his death and certainly there was no record of Christ having been the son of a
god. Furthermore, the Jesuits failed to convince the Polytheistic Gnostics that there was a *Creator of the Universe* at
all. The Missionaries had to fall back on the next best plan-to *assimilate* their Monotheistic saviour myth into a
*different* popular character from the eastern pantheon-[The Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism).
Fomenko summarizes
[the strategy](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html):

> The idea is to improve the icon of Jesus by assimilating it to the Buddha, at the same time that a new Christian Bible
> is conceived and Jewish stigmatization begins with them. Buddha and Jesus have similar biographies, because they are
> the fruit of a common project, and it is desired to unite them. For this reason, Jesuits are initially well received
> in China and Japan, while there is an awareness of being a common project associated with the glory of the same
> lineage.

## The Strategic Context: Why Asia Last

The sequencing of the Jesuit missionary campaign was not random. Europe and the Americas were priority targets because they were former Hordian territory whose populations still maintained living connections to the old Imperial religious traditions. Once those populations were safely converted to the new Monotheistic/Catholic order, Asia could be approached — but only from a position of established Western supremacy, economic leverage, and military presence.

The Jesuit accommodation strategy in China (the Chinese Rites controversy) attempted to present Christianity as compatible with Confucian ancestor veneration, while simultaneously infiltrating the Imperial Chinese court as astronomers and advisors. The NC context: the Manchurian dynasty that ruled China from 1644 was itself descended from Hordian Mongolian conquerors — distant relatives of the same Imperial line the Romanovs had displaced in Russia. The Jesuits were attempting to penetrate one of the last surviving branches of the old Empire from the inside.

The Tokugawa shogunate's violent expulsion of Christianity from Japan (the [Shimabara Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimabara_rebellion) of 1637–1638, after which Japan was essentially closed to Western contact until [1853](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Kanagawa)) represents the most successful resistance to this strategy. Japan's institutional memory of its connections to the Hordian Empire was strong enough to recognize and reject the Jesuit project. The country's two-century isolation was the result.

## Buddhism and the NC Framework

The NC observation that Buddhism and Christianity share biographical structures (the Buddha and Jesus have similar life stories, miraculous births, temptation narratives, teaching careers, and symbolic deaths) is not coincidence but design. Per the Marfull framework, both figures are expressions of the same underlying Imperial religious archetype — the Christ-Andronicus figure of the 12th century — adapted for different provincial audiences. When the Jesuits attempted to use Buddhist iconography and concepts to introduce Christianity to East Asia, they were unknowingly (or knowingly) reconnecting two branches of the same ancient root tradition.
