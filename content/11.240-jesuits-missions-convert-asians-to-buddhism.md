# Jesuits Missions convert Asians to Buddhism

`TODO: this section needs revision`

The success of the Jesuit missions in Europe, Africa, and America emboldened the Jesuits to target the last
remaining non-monotheistic indigenous religion left in the world-*Christianity*. In Western Europe, the Jesuits had
already *catharized* anyone associated with original Gnostic Christianity, but the Missionaries knew Asia would be more
difficult to conquer theologically and militarily.

The Jesuit mission to convert eastern *Gnostic* Christians into western Catholicism proved impossible. Any attempt to
proselytize Gnostics into the belief that Christ was the only *Son* of the *Creator God of the Universe* was met with
skepticism. Eastern Christians already had detailed records of Christ-their first Emperor and founder of the Rus-Horde
Empire-spanning hundreds of years after his death and certainly there was no record of Christ having been the son of a
god. Furthermore, the Jesuits failed to convince the Polytheistic Gnostics that there was a *Creator of the Universe* at
all. The Missionaries had to fall back on the next best plan-to *assimilate* their Monotheistic saviour myth into a
*different* popular character from the eastern pantheon-[The Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism).
Fomenko summarizes
[the strategy](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html):

> The idea is to improve the icon of Jesus by assimilating it to the Buddha, at the same time that a new Christian Bible
> is conceived and Jewish stigmatization begins with them. Buddha and Jesus have similar biographies, because they are
> the fruit of a common project, and it is desired to unite them. For this reason, Jesuits are initially well received
> in China and Japan, while there is an awareness of being a common project associated with the glory of the same
> lineage.
