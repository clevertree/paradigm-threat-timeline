# Livio Stecchini (1913–1979)

**Nationality:** Italian-American  
**Fields:** History of science, metrology, ancient astronomy

## Primary Contribution

Ancient astronomical metrology — proof that Babylonian records encode orbital parameters inconsistent with present planetary motions, and that ancient measurement systems encode geodetic knowledge that far exceeds what the conventional timeline assigns to those cultures. Stecchini collaborated closely with Alfred de Grazia and Ralph Juergens.

Jno Cook quotes him extensively throughout *Saturnian Cosmology* on plasma plumes in ancient records and astronomical period data.

## Contributions

- **Venus period analysis** — his papers "The Twenty-One Years of Venus" and "Cuneiform Astronomical Records and Celestial Coordinates" established that ancient Babylonian Venus records encode orbital periods and aphelion positions inconsistent with Venus's current orbit, directly supporting Velikovsky's displaced-orbit claim
- **Ancient metrology** — argued that Egyptian and Mesopotamian measurement systems (cubits, stadia, Persian units) encode precise geodetic and astronomical constants, implying observational knowledge far beyond what the conventional timeline assigns to those cultures. The cubit encodes the Earth's polar and equatorial radius with sub-percent accuracy
- **The Velikovsky Affair** — co-authored with de Grazia and Juergens the 1966 documentation of the academic suppression of Velikovsky, one of the earliest and most detailed records of institutional science censorship
- Cook cites Stecchini describing plasma plumes in ancient records as *"long streams of flame"* — these appear in Babylonian texts in contexts consistent with coronal mass ejections or close planetary plasma discharge events
