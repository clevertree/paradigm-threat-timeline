## Primary Contribution

Engineering-grade formalization of the Electric Universe plasma model. Scott is a retired professor of electrical engineering who applied electrical engineering principles directly to astrophysical phenomena. His work is cited by Jno Cook as the recommended resource for understanding the plasma physics underlying the Saturnian configuration.

## Contributions

- **Plasma mode diagrams** — formalized the three modes of plasma discharge (dark, glow, arc) and demonstrated that stellar coronas, cometary tails, nebular structure, and galactic morphology are better described by these modes than gravity-only models
- **The EU stellar model** — built Ralph Juergens's electric sun into engineering-grade analysis: calculated current flows, voltage potentials, and discharge geometries consistent with observed solar behavior, including the corona temperature paradox and solar wind acceleration profile
- **Birkeland current galactic structure** — argued that galaxies are organized along Birkeland current filaments rather than gravitational halos, consistent with the large-scale filamentary structure observed in galaxy surveys
- **Marklund convection** — explained the layered elemental abundances observed in stars as a natural consequence of plasma current sorting elements by ionization potential

Scott bridged the gap between Juergens's original hypotheses and the broader EU community, making the electrical model accessible to non-physicists. Cook lists him alongside Thornhill as essential for understanding the plasma physics of the polar configuration.
