# The "Hundred Years War" begins
As a result of the 14th-century Mongol-Hordian conquest, many vassal states formed across the planet. Some states
were created by peaceful means and rewarded by retaining their autonomy. Others were forged by warfare, conscription,
and taxes. The conventional [Hundred Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War) (1337–1453 CE),
fought nominally between England and France, is in the New Chronology a reflection of prolonged Hordian pacification
campaigns in Western Europe against populations resisting imperial rule.

Inevitably, micro-injustices within the Empire caused pockets of resistance, forming the early basis
of [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism). Many vassal regions chafed under the military
*tagma* (blood-tribute / conscription) and the taxation structure of the Horde. The Hordian campaign would drag on
in these regions, leading to a war lasting over a hundred years.

Fomenko and Nosovskiy note that the multiplication of place-names during the 14th–16th century conquests caused many
conflicts to be recorded twice — once in Russia-Horde chronicles and again in Western sources under different
geographical labels. The transfer of Russian-Turkic names (Cossack → Gascon; Tatar/Tartar → Tartar provinces of
France; *Rus* → Prussia, Persia, Paris) obscured the common origin of these events. The resistance that became the
Hundred Years' War was therefore inseparable from the broader religious schism: to resist the Horde was also to
defend local heterodox practice against the incoming Apostles' Christian orthodoxy of the Empire.
