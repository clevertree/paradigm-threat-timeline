## Primary Contribution

The most detailed mythological reconstruction of the Saturnian polar configuration, particularly the pre-configuration "God Star" era. Cardona spent decades developing the mytho-historical evidence for the Saturnian polar configuration, working closely with David Talbott and contributing extensively to *Kronos* and later *AEON*.

## Contributions

- **The God Star series** — six volumes reconstructing the sequence of Saturnian events from Saturn as single "sun" through the polar configuration to the catastrophic dispersal
- **Linguistic analysis** — traced the name "Saturn" and cognates across dozens of ancient cultures pointing to a single referent star/body
- **The proto-Saturnian epoch** — argued Saturn shone as a lone "sun" before entering the solar system and capturing Earth, meaning the earliest mythological memories predate the polar configuration itself
- **Detailed sequencing** of the mythological events in the polar configuration era, adding precision to Talbott's framework and providing the deep pre-history that Cook's chronology begins from
