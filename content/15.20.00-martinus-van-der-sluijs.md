# Martinus van der Sluijs

**Nationality:** Dutch  
**Fields:** Independent research, plasma mythology, comparative mythology

## Primary Contribution

Plasma mythology — systematic documentation of plasma discharge phenomena in ancient literary and mythological sources worldwide, extending Anthony Peratt's petroglyph work into written texts. Van der Sluijs has contributed extensively to the Thunderbolts Project and published refereed papers connecting specific plasma discharge physics to mythological traditions across cultures.

## Contributions

- **Plasma mythology catalog** — documented cross-cultural descriptions of the "world column," "cosmic axis," and "pillar of heaven" as consistent records of Birkeland current aurora events visible during the polar configuration's active phase
- **The mythological plasma dragon** — argued that dragon myths worldwide encode specific plasma instability shapes: kink instabilities, Z-pinch nodes, and double-layer discharge geometries matching laboratory plasma behavior
- **Literary extension of Peratt** — extended Peratt's petroglyph work into ancient texts: the same plasma column forms documented in rock art on every inhabited continent also appear in Mesopotamian, Indian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican written sources, suggesting continuous observation across millennia
- **The "extraordinary form" catalog** — compiled ancient descriptions of unusual atmospheric and celestial phenomena (pillars of fire, heavenly serpents, sky rivers, divine chariots) and mapped them against known plasma discharge geometries
