# The length of a year was 225 days

In this time Saturn was called [Kronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus), the *God before time began* and Creator
of the Universe (i.e. our solar system). Before clocks and calendars, the positions of the planets and stars were the
only way to tell time. Saturn's system was now orbiting our Sun, and with this apparent motion - time began. Our current
Sun was still hidden behind Saturn (and Jupiter) and was not yet visible to humans. As the spin of the Earth did not
change significantly from antiquity until modern times, so we can regard the length of a 'day' on Earth as a
constant. In this time the length of a year of orbit around the Sun was 225 days. This orbit was 40%
*faster* than our current orbit of 365.25 days. The changes of the length in the year occur periodically and suddenly in
history as the Earth jumps from one orbit to another, eventually reaching its individual orbit around the Sun. With each
jump, the Earth became part of a smaller configuration and drew in less energy from the Sun. This resulted in a
*slower* orbit.

## Kronos = Time

The name *Kronos* is not merely a convenient label. According to Jno Cook's *Recovering the Lost World: A Saturnian
Cosmology* (Appendix A, "Notes on Chronology"), **"Saturn or Kronos translates to 'time.'"** The visible crescent of
Saturn — lit by the real Sun on Saturn's rim — was the first index of the passage of time, the first "clock." As the
Earth rotated beneath Saturn, this crescent appeared to sweep counterclockwise around the globe on a daily basis,
brightening at night and dimming by day.

> *"We can actually claim that Saturn invented time — when it no longer blazed, but had reduced its output or dropped
> to dark mode. That is when a crescent would be seen at the edge of the globe, rotating counterclockwise on a daily
> basis. The first experience of clock-time had started for humanity."*
> — Jno Cook, *Saturnian Cosmology*, Chapter 14: The Start of Time
> ([saturniancosmology.org/time.php.html](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php.html))

This is the source of the myth of Kronos as the "God before time began": Saturn literally preceded the age of
measurable time — it *was* the mechanism that made time visible. When Jupiter displaced Saturn after 3147 BC, Jupiter
was described as replacing "the older God of Time and Beginnings, Kronos or Saturn" (Cook, *flood.php.html*).

## The 225-Day Year: Evidence from the Sumerian King-List

The specific figure of **225 days** is not arbitrary — it is derived mathematically from the Sumerian
*List of Kings Before the Flood*, a record that mainstream archaeology dismisses as fantastical because the reigns run
into tens of thousands of "years." Jno Cook argues these figures record *days*, not years, and that only a
225-day orbital year resolves the totals into whole-number multiples:

> *"A 225-day year is obvious from the 'kings before the flood.' It is the only close orbit that fits the data."*
> — Cook, *Saturnian Cosmology*, Appendix A: Notes on Chronology

The table of kings, reconverted at 225 days/year, yields reigns that are multiples of **32 years** — a number still
used in knuckle-counting systems in Pakistan today, and likely significant as a unit of astronomical tallying.

| King | City | Reign (sars) | Days | 225d/yr | Multiples of 32 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alulim | Eridug | 8 | 28,800 | 128 yr | 4 |
| Alaljar | Eridug | 10 | 36,000 | 160 yr | 5 |
| Enmenluana | Bad-Tibira | 12 | 43,200 | 192 yr | 6 |
| Enmengalana | Bad-Tibira | 8 | 28,800 | 128 yr | 4 |
| Dumuzid | Bad-Tibira | 10 | 36,000 | 160 yr | 5 |

The grand total on Earth: **241,200 days = 1,072 years** of kings before the flood, converted at 225 days/year.

## Orbital Mechanics: 0.72 AU

A 225-day year corresponds to an average orbital distance of **0.72 AU** from the Sun. This is almost exactly
**Venus's current orbit**. According to Cook (*Appendix B: Celestial Mechanics*, `mech.php.html`):

> *"If Saturn were on an eccentric orbit with a period of 225 days as experienced by its companion Earth... the average
> orbit of Saturn would have to be 0.72 AU. Assuming an eccentricity of 0.25, perihelion would have been at 0.54 AU
> and aphelion at 0.9 AU."*

For comparison: Kepler's third law gives a 0.70-AU orbit a period of $365.24 \times \sqrt{0.70^3} \approx 214$ days —
consistent with the 225-day figure for a slightly more distant or more elliptical path.

## The Complete Progression of Year-Lengths

The 225-day year was the *first* of a series of stepped orbital periods as Earth progressively detached from Saturn's
system and settled into its current solo orbit. Each step corresponds to a catastrophic event in myth and archaeology:

| Period (BC) | Days/Year | Orbit (AU) | Era |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8347 – 3147 | **225** | 0.72 | Second Creation (Saturn in sky) |
| 3147 – 2349 | 240 | 0.75 | Old Kingdom (after the Flood) |
| 2349 – 2193 | 260 | 0.79 | Fall of the Absu |
| 2193 – 1492 | 273 | 0.83 | Middle Kingdom |
| 1492 – 747 | 360 | 0.99 | New Kingdom |
| 747 – today | 365.24 | 1.00 | Current era |

*Source: Cook, Saturnian Cosmology, Appendix A — Solar Year Variables table.*

The jump from 360 to 365.24 days (747 BC) is corroborated by the ancient reform of calendars across multiple
civilizations: the Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, and Mesopotamians all revised their calendars during the 8th–7th centuries
BC, precisely when year-counts changed.

## Carbon-14 Corroboration

Cook notes that his calculated date corrections — derived purely from the shorter orbital years — track closely with
the fluctuations in calibrated Carbon-14 dates for the period 4077 BC–747 BC:

| Solar BC | Days/yr | Days short | CalcΔ (yrs) | C14 BP | C14Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| -4075 | 225 | 140.25 | 862 | 6030 | 712 |
| -3145 | 240 | 125.25 | 505 | 5100 | 563 |
| -1495 | 360 | 5.25 | 10.8 | 3450 | 235 |
| -745 | 365.24 | 0 | 0 | 2700 | 245 |

> *"The calculated dates are on the same order as the corrected Carbon-14 dates for the time span of 4077 BC to 747 BC."*

This means that the shorter-year chronology is not only internally consistent with ancient king-lists, but also
independently supported by isotope physics — radiocarbon calibration curves inadvertently capture the same orbital
history.

## The Era of 225 Days: 8347 – 3147 BC

The 225-day year spans **Cook's "Second Creation,"** extending from roughly 8347 BC to **3147 BC**, the cataclysm that ended the Saturnian configuration.
This 5,200-year period is the *Era of the Gods* of Sumerian mythology — when Saturn stood visibly in the northern sky,
Mars and Venus between it and Earth, and the plasma stalk (the *axis mundi*) connected them all.
The Olmec, Maya, Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Norse records all describe the same sky.
