# 14th Century C.E.: Great Expansion of the Mongol / Slavic Rus-Horde Empire

By the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, a final unification of the diverse peoples of Russia was
completed under **Georgiy Danilovich** (Grand Prince of Moscow), whom western and eastern sources record as **Genghis Khan**.
He united Vladimir and Suzdal Rus' under the rule of *Lord Novgorod the Great* — the chronicles' name for the capital
region centred on Yaroslavl. His brother **Ivan Danilovich Kalita** (recorded in western sources as both *Batu Khan* and
*Pope Innocent III*) continued the expansion and, according to Fomenko and Nosovskiy, **founded the Vatican and Rome in
Italy** as a western centre of social and religious power — the word *VATI-KAN* being a Latinised rendering of *Batu Khan*.

By the middle of the 14th century the Russian cavalry began their invasion of Europe, Africa and India, in a
wide-reaching offensive. As a result a considerable part of Eurasia was colonized. In the Western European sources
the Rus-Horde is reflected as the **Habsburg Empire of the XIV–XVI cc.** — *Habsburg* itself possibly deriving from
the Slavonic *HAB* (= NEW) + *BURG* (= CITY), i.e. **Novgorod = New City**. Scaligerian Chronology elsewhere remembers
Rus-Horde as the **Etruscans** who founded Rome: 19th-century scholars Chertkov and Volansky demonstrated that Etruscan
inscriptions are readable as Slavonic, and the Etruscans called themselves *Rasenna* — the Rasens, the Russians.
The Horde chose **Florence** as the Italian capital; the Imperial headquarters was established separately, forming what
later became Rome.

With the expansion of the Empire came monumental construction across the known world, all dated by Fomenko to the
same 14th–16th century window:
- Magnificent [Tartarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-27/inside-architecture-s-wildest-conspiracy-theory) style cathedrals and chambers across Western Europe and North America
- The **Great Wall of China**
- The massive **Hagia Sophia** in Istanbul (identified as the Temple of Solomon / Jerusalem = Czar-Grad)
- The **Great Sphinx** and **Egyptian Pyramids** at Giza — built in geopolymer concrete by Cossack-Hordian Mamelukes
- The megalithic platform at **Baalbek** (Lebanon)
- Great pyramids and temples of Central America

In Egypt, a central imperial cemetery was established near the Giza plateau to inter the mummified Czar-Khans.
The dry sand [preserved](http://www.historyshistories.com/egypt-burial-practices.html) the bodies transported
by large oared boats (*strugi*) across the Mediterranean — the "River Styx" of Egyptian mythology. The *30 dynasties
of Egyptian pharaohs* are, in this reconstruction, phantom reflections of the dynasty of Russian czar-khans of the
13th–16th centuries. The famous **Hyksos** invasion of Egypt corresponds to the Mongol-Hordian conquest of the 14th century.
