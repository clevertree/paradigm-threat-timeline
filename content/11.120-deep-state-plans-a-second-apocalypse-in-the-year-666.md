# Deep State plans a second Apocalypse in the year ι666

The opportunity for another Apocalypse came with the approaching date of <code>ι</code>666 written as
<code>in the 666th year of the Lord</code>. The Deep State's motivations were the same as in 1492 C.E.-to strike the
*fear of God* into the Protestants and consolidate the local governments under the centralized authority of the Church.
Having conquered all remaining world religions, the **Deep State** was in a position to misrepresent ancient chronologies
of their conquered vassals, specifically-the violent memory of the *ending* of the Golden Age. Going forward, the
Apocalypse date would be represented not as a history of the Earth's formation, but as a *prophecy* of how the world
will end in the *future* - with a

by the creator god [Jehovah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah).

> During the first half of the seventeenth century some extravagant notions of the near approach of the Messianic time,
> and more especially of the redemption of the Jews and their return to Jerusalem, were set forth by Christian writers
> and entertained by Jews and Christians alike. The so - called apocalyptic year was assigned by Christian authors to the
> year 1666.

*The Polish theologian, historian and astronomer, Stanisław Lubieniecki (1623–1675) observed both comets from his house in Hamburg. He corresponded with Ismäel Boulliau (1605–1694) in Paris and Henry Oldenburg (1618–1677), secretary of the Royal Society in London about the 1664 comet. In 1668 he published a three-part work on both comets, his Theatrum cometicum. Part one contained his correspondence on the topic with other European astronomers. The second part consisted of criticism by other scholars of his cometary theories and his answers to his critics, whilst the third part contained his astrological interpretations, including his opinion that the Great Fire of London was a punishment from God announced by the 1664 comet.
