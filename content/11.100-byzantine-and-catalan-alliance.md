# Byzantine and Catalan alliance

The Byzantine-Catalan alliance of the early 14th century (per the Scaligerian dating) represents an intersection of two important forces in the NC reconstruction: the dying remnants of the Eastern Empire and the military mercenary class (the Almogavars) that the new Western powers were deploying across the Mediterranean. The Catalan Company — the same mercenaries who would go on to conquer Athens and the Duchy of Neopatria — first entered Byzantine service ostensibly to fight the expanding Ottoman forces, but ended up devastating Byzantine Greece when their payments stopped. In the NC framework, this episode represents the transition moment when the old Hordian/Byzantine administrative class lost control of its own military contractors.

> Byzantine and Catalan alliance for the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, where the Almogavars devastate Greece
> under the warrior spirit of Saint George
