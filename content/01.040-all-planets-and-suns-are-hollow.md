# All planets and suns are hollow

![Hollow Earth Diagram](/media/01.before-creation/hollow-earth-diagram.png)

The reason for the Absu having multiple layers, as depicted on ancient artifacts, is described in the theory of
[Electromagnetism](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnets.html).
In this theory, any object with energy passing through/around it will
[polarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizability),
causing the lines of magnetic flux to appear in layers of different charge. At high amplitude, matter sticks to each
layer eventually forming concentric circles within the body to increasingly capacitate that energy. As a result,
charging a space body (like a planet) with additional energy will cause it to grow in size. As a planet grows in size,
the gap between the inner circles expands, causing the planet to become [hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfFJiUWuDk).

## The Lazeria Map Collection: Cartographic Evidence for a Polar Opening

[Watch: Lazeria Map Collection — Is the Earth Hollow?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izh1CSJL9SU&list=PLdYCrt6hIRKYlfT3yTqgUIZvnWkqsSN_e&index=48)

The Lazeria Map Collection is a guided tour through some of the rarest and oldest maps in existence, many of which
consistently depict the North Pole in a way that mainstream cartography has since erased. The collection demonstrates
that from at least the 1500s through the early 1700s, respected European cartographers — working independently and
separated by generations — recorded the same details about the Arctic pole: **four rivers flowing inward toward a
central sea, and that sea draining downward into the interior of the Earth**.

These details appear on navigational maps used by actual sailors and explorers, not on decorative or allegorical
works. The maps were republished in multiple editions over decades, indicating they were considered accurate, not
mythological.

### Gerard Mercator's Polar Map (1569)

Gerard Mercator (1512–1594), perhaps the most respected cartographer in European history, produced a detailed map of
the Northern Hemisphere that shows the North Pole region divided into **four large islands** — called the **Bargo
Islands** — separated by four rivers flowing northward toward a central polar sea. The Latin text on the map reads:

> *"Four channels break up the island and they produce 19 mouths or openings to the outer ocean. The rivers flow to
> the north and empty into the inner earth. The canyon which lies beneath the pole is approximately 33 leagues wide."*

33 leagues is approximately **100 modern miles**. This central canyon — described on the map as *"Rupes Nigra et
Altissima"* ("a very dark and high canyon") — is located at the precise geographic pole and receives the inflow of
all four rivers. The map further notes that the flow of one of the channels is "so great northwards that it never
freezes throughout the whole year."

Mercator's 1569 map was the most famous world map in all of Europe at the time. His grandson Rumold Mercator
re-engraved it in 1587, and his other grandson Michael Mercator produced a version used from 1595 through 1636.
All versions retain the same polar detail identically. This is not one man's speculation — it was a transmitted
cartographic tradition spanning at least 70 years and three generations.

Mercator himself wrote to Dr. John Dee in 1577 explaining that there were **four rivers in the northern region with
a very strong inward flow** — and that sailors who were caught in these rivers had virtually no way out.

### Matthias Quad's Polar Map (1600)

Matthias Quad (1557–1613), another highly respected geographer and master engraver, produced a detailed Arctic map
in 1600 whose reverse side contains a full Latin description of the polar region. The translation confirms the same
structure described by Mercator:

> *"The large island is almost the shape of a circle which has at its center a sea, which in its center lies the
> Great Dark Canyon. This major island is partitioned into four smaller ones by four rivers flowing in a cross-like
> formation from the ocean into the central sea, and they contain numerous small openings into the ocean."*

The text also provides navigation instructions specific to the polar region, noting that at the North Pole **all
directional points are reversed** — a compass pointing north actually leads south toward Iceland, a compass pointing
east leads to America, etc. This is a practical navigational note, not mythology.

Quad was banned by the Church in 1600 — the same year this map was printed.

### The Schonerland Map (1740)

A later map attributed to Georg Matthias Seutter (1668–1757), printed in 1740, is widely dismissed by mainstream
cartographers as a "fantasy map." The Lazeria collection challenges this dismissal directly. The map:

- Includes **three independent measurement scales** — a detail that would be meaningless on a purely allegorical
  work
- Shows a recognizable landmass with rivers, cities, and provinces with measured distances
- Contains a description of **"the island where the machine that controls the weather is located"**
- Has a line below the equator reading that **"the sun is the same both day and night"** — consistent with an inner
  sun of constant illumination
- References scripture from the Sermon on the Mount, suggesting a **Protestant provenance at a time when all
  academic maps were still in Latin** — this is a vernacular map made for circulation outside the Church

The map may represent the interior geography of Earth as reported by explorers who entered through the polar
opening, encoded in the satirical language of an allegory to avoid Church censure.

### Frisland: The Sunken Island

Nearly every major navigational map from 1570 to the mid-1600s shows an island called **Frisland** (also spelled
Freezeland) in the North Atlantic, positioned between Greenland and Iceland. The Lazeria collection documents its
appearance on the 1570 Abraham Ortelius map, the 1594 Doetecum map, Gerard Mercator's full polar map, Michael
Mercator's 1595 map, John Speed's 1627 English map, the 1630 Blaeu map, and the Hendrick Hondius map. Hondius
himself was tutored by Gerard Mercator.

The Quad 1600 map's Latin text on Frisland reads:

> *"Frisland is said to be larger than Ireland and was unknown to the Ancients. The climate is extremely harsh.
> Inhabitants do not have any fruits but live on Seafood. Furthermore, many of them have sailed throughout the
> ocean and brought their loaded ships to all Maritime European cities and to many nations of Africa and Asia.
> During this period English ships frequently went to Frisland and it became known as Western England. There you
> can find a maximum daylight of 19 hours."*

Explorers from the late 1600s onward took soundings in the area and found a large submerged landmass. Soundings
taken as late as **1944 by two separate admirals** confirmed an area approximately 27 miles in diameter lying only
about 30 fathoms beneath the surface of the North Sea. Mainstream history calls Frisland mythological. The
physical evidence suggests it sank.

## Arctic Explorer Accounts: Open Polar Seas and Warmth at the Pole

The cartographic evidence is corroborated by a consistent pattern in the accounts of real Arctic explorers, who
report conditions that make no sense if the pole is simply a featureless sheet of ice:

- **Joseph Moxon (1652)** recorded meeting a Dutch sailor who had just returned from a voyage reaching **2 degrees
  beyond the North Pole**, where the vessel encountered an open sea. The sailor's exact words: *"It was as warm as
  Amsterdam in the summer."*

- **Explorer Elisha Kent Kane (1854)** reached the north of Greenland, climbed to the top of the tallest cliffs on
  the coast, and recorded seeing *"vast open polar seas with no ice and heavy breakers."* At **latitude 82° north**
  he found **butterflies, bees, flies, wolves, foxes, bears, geese, ducks, and partridges**.

- **Lt. Hooper, Royal Navy (1849–1850)** recorded hearing the Aurora Borealis not once but many times —
  *"loudly and unmistakably... at first resembling the sound of field ice, then like the sound of a water mill,
  and at last like the woring of cannon shot."*

- **Dr. Fridtjof Nansen** recorded in his diary that it became *warmer* as he approached the pole. His compass
  began behaving erratically. He found open water consistently to the northwest throughout an extended period of
  mild weather. He turned back specifically because he felt he was lost due to compass failure — not due to ice.

- **Multiple explorers** noted the same anomaly: **animals do not migrate south to escape the Arctic winter —
  they migrate north.** Polar bears, geese, and other species are always encountered heading further north, not
  south. This is inexplicable if the pole is only frozen ocean.

- **A Nordic explorer** (recorded account, date unspecified) reported sailing beyond the pole into a warm open
  sea, then entering *"a vast canyon leading into the interior of the earth"* with a sun shining inside. He and
  his companion spent a year in the interior before returning.

The wreckage of the **USS Jeannette**, crushed in the Arctic in 1881, drifted **3,500 miles** — passing through
the area of the presumed polar ice cap — and was recovered near the southern tip of Greenland. If that region is
solid polar ice, drift of nearly 3,500 miles through it is mechanically impossible without a through-channel.

## What the Maps Describe vs. What We Are Told

| Feature | Pre-1700 Maps / Explorer Accounts | Modern Orthodoxy |
|---|---|---|
| North Pole center | Central sea → dark canyon → inner earth | Solid polar ice cap |
| Four rivers | Flow inward and downward into Earth | Not acknowledged |
| Bargo Islands | Four large islands surrounding the pole | Not acknowledged |
| Open polar sea | Reported by Kane, Nansen, Moxon, others | Denied; attributed to error |
| Animal migration | Species migrate north, not south, in winter | Unexplained |
| Compass behavior | Erratic near pole; directional reversal | Attributed to magnetic variation |
| Frisland | Documented on 15+ major navigational maps | Declared mythological |
| Warmth near pole | Reported consistently by explorers | Unexplained |

The Lazeria Map Collection's conclusion is not that the hollow Earth is proven — it is that the evidence has never
been addressed. Mainstream cartographic history does not explain why Frisland sank, why dozens of independent maps
describe the same polar rivers and central sea, or why explorer accounts of open water and warmth were systematically
excluded from the record after the age of institutional polar expeditions began.

*[The Electric Universe Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Universe-Wallace-Thornhill/dp/B007SP1LK8) posits that galaxies, stars (including our Sun), and comets can be best understood through the well-tested behavior of electricity—the one force about which astronomers seem to know almost nothing, a force that is 10^36 or more times as strong as gravity.*
