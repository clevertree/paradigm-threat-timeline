# Disputes against Jews reemerge

The breaking up of the Russian Empire resulted in the creation of
the [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora)
and [Gypsy / Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_diaspora) diasporas. Both groups had been accustomed to
traveling between the vassal states of the Empire, and now found themselves cut off from their old imperial ties. Jews
found themselves at the highest level of authority in each region-in control of the money, trade economies, and
[monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe) left behind, while Gypsies, named after an Empire that
no longer existed, became a powerless people. Eventually, disputes between the common folk (gentiles) and Jews emerged
over every facet of life, from [eating rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut)
to [monetary policy](https://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/history-ideas/2019/06/filthy-lucre-a-look-at-the-history-of-jews-and-money/).

## The Imperial Treasury Caste

The New Chronology offers a structural explanation for why the Jewish community survived the Empire's collapse when so many other groups did not. In the Hordian Empire, social organization followed a hereditary caste model. Different clans occupied different professional roles across generations. Within this system, the Hordian financial officers — those who managed the accounts of the Empire across Europe, Africa, and America, collecting taxes, paying salaries, controlling precious metal flows, and financing the army — formed a distinct professional caste. Their work demanded precision, accounting skill, and a strict regulatory mindset (hence the elaborate Talmudic legal system's emphasis on financial rules).

This caste operated globally by necessity: an Imperial banker in Egypt and one in England had far stronger professional ties than two soldiers stationed in distant provinces. Over generations, this tight-knit professional guild developed its own religious community, which became a recognizable strand of what we now call Judaism. Crucially, this guild had no need for a territorial state — their "country" was the Empire itself, which gave them free movement across all its provinces. When the Empire collapsed, they retained that cosmopolitan mobility and professional network, while the warrior castes and administrative nobles were territorialized and eventually replaced by new local dynasties. ([Chronologia, Ch.9 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/09.html))

## Power of Money Erupts

Fomenko identifies the critical transition point: in the 16th and early 17th centuries, as the Empire fractured, the previously subordinate financial caste found itself in an unprecedented position of power. The military governors of the new independent states — the kings of Germany, France, England, etc. — believed they were the victors. They were not. The driving force behind the revolutionary wave that swept Europe (the English Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Dutch Republic before them) was capital overriding nobility. The [Miser Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Covetous_Knight) pattern became the new political reality: the Imperial knight demanding his rightful salary from the treasury official who now controlled the cash.

> *"The driving force behind all such revolutions was money. As a result they openly declared the domination of money over noble rank, over ancestry. This was the motto of the French revolution and of the English revolution. In the Horde Empire there ruled a principle of ancestry and gentility. Nobility was respected and entitled to power. After the revolt of the Reformation, wealth acquired precedence."* — Fomenko, [Ch.9 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/09.html)

The ghettos that appeared across Europe after 1615 were not a continuation of ancient prejudice. They were a new phenomenon — a response to the collapse of the Empire whose treasury system the Jewish community had administered. Once that Imperial authority was gone, the local kingdoms had no institutional framework for integrating the former Imperial officials. A 1615 document from the Lutheran Chronograph records the expulsion of Jews from Worms in that year — directly after the Time of Troubles, when the old Imperial order finally dissolved. ([Chronologia, Ch.9 §3](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/09.html))
