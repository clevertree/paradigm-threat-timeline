# Cossack–Polish War begins ethnic cleansing of Russians in Ukraine

[Pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom#Historical_background) against anyone associated with the old Empire
(particularly Jews and Poles) became increasingly commonplace leading up to
the [Khmelnytsky Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising) started by
Jesuit [Bohdan Khmelnytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising). Historians estimate anywhere
from 40, 000 to 100, 000 men, women and children (or perhaps more) were murdered by Cossacks.
