# C.E. Deep State targets independent banks

Part of the plan for any religious-military conquest is the issuing of a centralized currency and usury-based banking
system to all conquered regions. In the height of the Russian Empire, the port of London was a major
center for international trade. During the Reformation, many rich merchants would store their gold in London. Agents of
the Deep State knew the financial independence of London goldsmiths must be crushed in order to create a centralized
banking system under their control.

By 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne following years of civil war where an estimated 200, 000 Britons died.
Citing interest rates on gold as high as 20 %, Parliament passed “An Act for restraining the taking of Excessive Usury” –
capping the maximum rate at 6 %. At the same time, Charles persuades Parliament to
impose [hearth taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth_tax#England) on the British people which required biyearly
audits of every household. Where Parliament wouldn't agree with Charles, he bypassed them by borrowing directly from the
goldsmiths in exchange for "tax futures" tallied to the smiths at a discount. By 1671, the discount on the King’s tax
debt reached 10 % which was above the 6 % cap and thus could not be paid back. In 1672, the King wrote a
[letter](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/museum/online-collections/blog/why-was-the-bank-of-england-founded) to
the
> “Gentlemen, I’m an honest man, but unfortunately I am unable to pay my debts back on this occasion. Sorry – will see

As a result of the [Great Stop of 1672](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_of_the_Exchequer), the majority of London's
goldsmiths were ruined, and as many as ten thousand families were *financially embarrassed*. The Deep State had
successfully mitigated the threat of independent banking and would now be able to establish a new *centralized* banking
system (finalized by 1694).

*[Inter-religious dispute Judaism-Christianity (1633-1725)](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html). Summing up, according to this basic reconstruction, the Catalan affinity with the Jewish one is better understood, and the hostile vision of the Holy Inquisition, Castilian and Bourbon. But other issues of greater significance are understood. After the Barcelona Dispute, the Order of Saint Jerome was created, whose mission is to write the Bible in Latin, and with it the historical character of Jesus is built. Then (not before), Ramon Llull conceived the Rex Bellator project, with the Catalan, Italian and Roman authority, which ended up rebuilding the Order of the Temple of Solomon in the form of the Order of Saint John the Baptist, with which the European colonizer project began.*
