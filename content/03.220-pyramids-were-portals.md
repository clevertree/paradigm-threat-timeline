# Pyramids were Portals

With the help of human giants, civilizations built all the pyramids of
Egypt, Mesopotamia, England, China, and the South American Andes in less than 200 years.
These pyramids were **[man-made quantum tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)** —
an "Artificial Bifröst" that made it once again possible for humans to travel between planets.
See [Quantum Entanglement](/content/02.100-quantum-entanglement.md) for the Golden Age origins of this technology.
