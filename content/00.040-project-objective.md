# Project Objective

![Fomenko books - USA has Issues with British Maps](/media/00-project-objective/fomenko_books.jpg)
*[USA has Issues](https://www.amazon.com/Issues-British-Maps-century-History-ebook/dp/B013B019Z0) with British Maps of 18th-century analyses in detail the maps of the 1771 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica and concludes that the Northwestern part of the United States of America was built on remains of Moscuvite Tartary.*

The objective of this timeline is to compile an [alternate history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history)
of Earth based on [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.everythingselectric.com/wallace-thornhill/)
and [Fomenko's *New Chronology*](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/index.html)
into an accessible sequence of events from the first memory to modern day. As new research comes to light, I plan on
making corrections to this timeline. I'm hoping this project helps others navigate the _dissonance of consensus_, and be
able to access the *unredacted* origin story of our planet and our species. This timeline focuses on the *causality*
between major events (i.e. why one event led to the next), so not all events of world history are listed.
