# Bible is translated into Latin

The [Gutenberg Bible](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gutenberg-bible) was a translation of the original Cyrillic
bible into the Vulgate Latin significantly redacting its text and conforming the New Testament narrative to the western
*austere* perspective. For over 200 years, the western Churches refused even to mention the name of Andronicus-Christ,
writing his name down as the letter <code> ι </code>. Now, he would be renamed **Jesus Christ** taking advantage of the
latin alphabet-and elevated to the position of **Son of God**. Historians give Johannes Gutenberg credit for the
invention of the printing press in 1454, although it was already in use by the Rus-Horde Empire for at least two
centuries prior. Historians also attribute the translation of the Vulgate Latin Bible to St. Jerome in the *4th*
century, however Fomenko demonstrates this to be a duplicate of the same event shifted backwards by 1053 years.
