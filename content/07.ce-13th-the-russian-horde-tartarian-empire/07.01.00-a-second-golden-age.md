# A Second Golden Age

By organizing the Crusades against Istanbul, the Deep State had a blueprint for expanding conquest. Andronicus Christ — the first emperor of the Rus Horde Empire — spoke against usury and slavery, but the Horde still imposed taxation and conscription on conquered vassals. The army was predominantly horse cavalry (horses were native to the Volga-Don steppes), enabling rapid movement over great distances. The Russian czars-khans equipped the Horde with iron weapons — expensive and unaffordable in the Mediterranean. To feed army and vassals, *slash and burn* farming was invented: entire forests incinerated to create agricultural land. Deforestation continued ~200 years until ~1503, when the Horde switched to three-field rotation after recognizing that soil dries up after 30 years without natural reclamation.

De Grazia's *Homo Schizo I* proposes "cultural hologenesis" — simultaneous emergence of culture worldwide triggered by shared catastrophe. The rapid formation of the Rus-Horde Empire across diverse peoples (Slavs, Turkics, Finno-Ugrics, Caucasians) in a single generation mirrors this pattern.

At the end of the 13th century, [final unification](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html#uni8) occurred under Grand Prince Georgii Danilovich — identified in [western sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan) as Genghis Khan.

## The Second Golden Age

The 13th century was a **second Golden Age** — brief, explosive, and unprecedented since the fall of [Atlantean civilization](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.07.00-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md).

When the Crusaders breached Troy and captured Jerusalem #1 (Istanbul), they cracked open the Deep State's vault. The Temple of Jerusalem contained the accumulated secrets of the old order: Atlantean technology, suppressed sciences, astronomical records, engineering principles. The [Masons](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.01-the-masons.md) who built the empire's great structures were the first beneficiaries — the speed of their construction across three continents testifies to the quality of what they found.

The Rus-Horde did not hoard this knowledge — they *taught* it. The empire was the **first human republic on Earth**, built on a singular form of authority: **sacrificial legitimacy**. Christ — the giant prince of Rus' — had been crucified by the Deep State, and his martyrdom was the foundational event. No other family could claim their ancestor had died for the people and *still* risen to conquer the world in his name. The people followed willingly. The Atlantean secrets were shared openly. For approximately three generations, humanity experienced what it had not known since before the Dark Ages: rulers who served the ruled.

## The Taint Within the Bloodline

The Deep State had not been destroyed at Jerusalem — it had *relocated*. Their target was the **bloodline itself**: the single point of failure. As long as a genuine descendant of Christ sat on the throne, usury, manufactured religion, and artificial scarcity had no purchase. The republic was immune because it was built on something they could not counterfeit.

So they married into the bloodline, placed advisors near the heirs, and introduced dependencies that weakened each successive generation. Within three generations, the taint had taken hold. The rulers who bore Christ's name no longer carried his will. The knowledge began to be restricted — not by the Horde, but by the parasitic class now embedded within it.

This was the [Oprichnina](/content/10.ce-16th-the-great-division/10.06.00-oprichnina.md) in embryo — the mechanism by which the Deep State would seize the throne outright, installing the [Romanov dynasty](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.00.00-1600-ce-17th-century-from-empire-to-invisible-government.md) centuries later. The pattern is identical to every Deep State infiltration: they cannot build, create, or lead — but they can corrupt what others build, and they are infinitely patient.
