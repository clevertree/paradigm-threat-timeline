# A Second Golden Age

![The Second Golden Age](/media/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/the-second-golden-age.png)

By organizing the Crusades against Istanbul, the Deep State had a blueprint for expanding their conquest. Andronicus
Christ-the first emperor of the Rus Horde Empire-spoke against usury and slavery, but still after seizing control of
Istanbul, the Horde imposed both taxation and conscription on their new vassals. They would continue to do this in every
region they conquered. During the war, the army raised by the Horde was predominantly horse cavalry as horses were
native in the steps between the Volga and Don rivers. This allowed the army to move quickly over great distances. The
Russian czars-khans were able to equip the Horde with iron weapons, which in the Mediterranean were quite expensive and
unaffordable to many. To feed their army and new vassals, a new type of *slash and burn* farming was invented. Entire
forests were incinerated to create agricultural land allowing for mass harvesting without fertilization. Deforestation
continued for another 200 years until around 1503 when the Horde finally switched to the three-field system. They
realized that farm soil dries up after 30 years, unless the land is reclaimed by nature.

De Grazia's *Homo Schizo I* proposes "cultural hologenesis" — the simultaneous emergence of human culture worldwide
triggered by shared catastrophe rather than gradual diffusion. The rapid formation of the Rus-Horde Empire across
enormously diverse peoples — Slavs, Turkics, Finno-Ugrics, Caucasians — in a single generation mirrors this pattern:
a post-catastrophic society reassembles quickly under strong leadership, forging new institutions from the wreckage of
the old order.

At the end of the 13th century, a [final unification](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html#uni8) of the
diverse peoples of Russia took place, partly peacefully, partly through military means, under the Grand Prince (or khan),
Georgii Danilovich — identified in [western sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan) as Genghis Khan. The
full story of his conquests and the subsequent expansion into Europe, Africa, and India belongs to the 14th century.

## The Second Golden Age

The 13th century was not merely a period of military expansion. It was a **second Golden Age** — brief, explosive, and unprecedented since the fall of the original [Atlantean civilization](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.07.00-atlantis-and-the-tree-of-knowledge.md).

When the Crusaders breached the walls of Troy and captured Jerusalem #1 (Istanbul), they did not merely topple a political regime. They **cracked open the Deep State's vault**. The Temple of Jerusalem — the seat of Monotheist authority for centuries — contained the accumulated secrets of the old order: the forbidden knowledge of Atlantean technology, suppressed sciences, astronomical records, engineering principles, and the esoteric methods by which the Deep State had maintained its stranglehold over human civilization since the Dark Ages. The [Masons](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.01-the-masons.md) who built the empire's great structures were the first beneficiaries of this knowledge — and the speed of their construction across three continents testifies to the quality of what they found.

For the first time since the catastrophes that ended the original Golden Age, the forbidden knowledge poured out freely. The Rus-Horde did not hoard it as the Deep State had. They *taught* it. The empire that emerged was not a theocracy or a military junta — it was the **first human republic on Earth**, answerable to a single bloodline that the entire civilized world recognized as legitimate. And the reason for that recognition was singular and unrepeatable: **that bloodline had already made the ultimate sacrifice**. Christ — the giant prince of Rus' — had been crucified by the Deep State, and his martyrdom was the foundational event of the empire. No one questioned the authority of his descendants, because no other family on Earth could claim that their ancestor had died for the people and *still* his people had risen to conquer the world in his name.

This was the essential difference between the Rus-Horde republic and every empire that preceded or followed it. The [Pyramidal Empire](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.05.00-the-pyramidal-empire.md) ruled through technology and control of the quantum gates. The Deep State ruled through religious deception and usury. But the Horde ruled through **legitimacy** — the only form of authority that does not require constant coercion to maintain. A blood descendant of Christ sat on the throne. The people followed willingly. The Atlantean secrets were shared openly. And for approximately three generations, humanity experienced something it had not known since before the Dark Ages: a civilization where the rulers served the ruled.

## The Taint Within the Bloodline

It ended as rapidly as it began.

The Deep State had not been destroyed at Jerusalem. It had *relocated*. While the Crusaders celebrated and the Horde expanded, the Deep State's agents were already doing what they had always done: infiltrating, intermarrying, advising, and positioning themselves within the inner circle of power. Their target was not the army or the territory — it was the **bloodline itself**.

The Deep State understood, with perfect clarity, that no system of control, no religious institution, no military order, and no political arrangement could survive as long as a genuine blood descendant of Christ sat on the throne of the world empire. The bloodline was the **single point of failure** in their plan for world domination. As long as the people could look at their ruler and say "his ancestor died for us," the Deep State's instruments of deception — usury, manufactured religion, artificial scarcity — had no purchase. The republic was immune to their techniques because it was built on something they could not counterfeit: **sacrificial legitimacy**.

So they did what they always do. They married into the bloodline. They placed advisors near the heirs. They introduced luxuries and dependencies that weakened each successive generation. Within **three generations** of Christ's martyrdom, the taint had taken hold. The bloodline was no longer pure. The rulers who bore Christ's name no longer carried his will. The Atlantean knowledge that had flowed freely began to be restricted again — not by the Horde, but by the parasitic class now embedded within it.

This was the **Oprichnina** in embryo — the mechanism by which the Deep State would eventually seize the throne outright, installing the [Romanov dynasty](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.00.00-1600-ce-17th-century-from-empire-to-invisible-government.md) centuries later. But the seed was planted here, in the 13th century, at the height of the second Golden Age. The pattern is identical to every Deep State infiltration in this timeline: they cannot build, they cannot create, they cannot lead — but they can corrupt what others have built, and they are infinitely patient.

The capture of the bloodline was, in the Deep State's own calculus, the **single most important operation in the history of the world**. More important than the Crucifixion. More important than the relocation of Jerusalem. More important than any war or plague or technological suppression. Because once the bloodline was theirs — once the people's trust in their rulers could be redirected toward Deep State puppets wearing Christ's family name — then every other instrument of control became possible. The religions could be rewritten. The sciences could be suppressed. The [giants](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.02-the-giants-of-the-rus-horde.md) could be hunted. And the second Golden Age could be buried so thoroughly that no one would ever know it had existed.
