# First Olympic Games

In memory of the religious plurality that followed the Crusades the Olympic Games would be held every 4 years throughout
the Empire. Coliseums were built to host the events in western states like France, Italy, Tunisia, and Croatia. They
were never used for gladiator fights which mostly occurred
on [public squares](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC013EN.html) outside the boundaries of imperial law.

## De Grazia: The Games as Post-Catastrophe Reassembly

De Grazia notes in *Chaos and Creation* that the first Olympic Games "marked a reassembly of Greeks" after a period of
devastating celestial conflict — the age when Mars repeatedly approached the Earth. The founder of the games was
"none other than Hercules, alter ego of planet Mars." In Scaligerian chronology the first Games date to 776 BCE; in
the Fomenko chronology this reassembly corresponds to the post-Crusade pacification of the late 13th century CE — the
same impulse to mark a new era of civilization after devastating conflict.

The Games were accompanied by the adoption of a new calendar. De Grazia writes: "Nabonassar, an obscure king of Babylon,
gave his name to a new era of the calendar in the year 747 B.C." and notes that two Dutch scientists reviewed
radiocarbon, tree ring, and varve studies pointing to "a considerable lengthening of the solar year, from perhaps 280
to 365 days, around 780 B.C." Whether dated to the 8th century BCE or the 13th century CE, the pattern is consistent:
the Olympic Games inaugurated a new calendar marking the end of a catastrophic era and the beginning of ordered
civilization.

The coliseums built across the empire — massive arenas in France, Italy, Tunisia, and Croatia — are conventionally dated
to "ancient Rome" but the Fomenko chronology attributes them to the Rus-Horde construction program of the 13th–14th
centuries. Their architectural uniformity across vast distances speaks to a single centralized empire, not independent
city-states separated by centuries.
