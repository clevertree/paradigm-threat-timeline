# The Giants of the Rus-Horde

![The Giants of the Rus-Horde](/media/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/giants-of-the-rus-horde.png)

The word **Horde** (Russian: *Orda*) derives from the Russian *RAT'* (рать), meaning **army**, and the country *RUTHENIA* meant *RATNAYA* — a **military** country. The "Mongol" in "Mongol Empire" comes from *MNOGO* (много) meaning **many**, or Greek *MEGALION* meaning **great** ([Fomenko, ch.3 §7](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html)). The deliberate mistranslation of *Orda* as "horde" — conjuring disorderly savages — is part of a centuries-long campaign to obscure a disciplined imperial civilisation whose leadership caste were **giant, hairy humans** descending from an ancient lineage.

## The Giant Leadership

The Rus-Horde's ruling class — descendants of the [Wild People](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) — were of enormous stature, covered in body hair, and venerated as living connections to the pre-catastrophe world. Christ himself, born of the hairy giant [Mary of Rus'](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md), founded this dynasty. The giants possessed knowledge systems, religious traditions, and physical capabilities that made them ungovernable by the Deep State's emerging institutions. They had their own bibles, chronicles, and matrilineal religious tradition.

*The surviving giants and their descendants recorded the events of the Golden Age and Dark Ages — preserving ancient knowledge in the first chronicles.*

## The Codex Gigas: A Giant's Bible

The [Codex Gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Gigas) — literally "Giant Book" — is the largest extant medieval manuscript: **92 cm tall, 50 cm wide, 74.8 kg**, composed of 310 vellum leaves requiring ~160 donkey skins. Created in the early 13th century at the Benedictine monastery of Podlažice in Bohemia, it contains the entire Latin Bible, Josephus's works, Isidore's *Etymologiae*, medical texts, and a full-page portrait of the Devil.

A 36-inch, 165-pound book cannot be held, carried, or read at a desk built for a normal monk. It was made for a **giant reader**. The "Devil" depicted — green-skinned, hairy, clawed, horned — is the demonised portrait of the race the book served. The first page includes **Early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets** — the scripts of Rus'. Twelve pages were later removed by unknown hands.

## The Word "Horde" as Demonisation

The Latin *ordo* means **order** — military order, religious order. The Russian *Orda* is cognate. The Golden Horde, Blue Horde, White Horde were **ordered military structures**, not chaotic mobs. Western historiography inverted this: *Horde* became a word for savage swarms. This follows the pattern applied to every targeted population: demonise, destroy, rewrite.

## Three Wars Against the Giants

1. **The Crusade of the early 12th century** — the first campaign against giant populations, triggered by the [Crucifixion of Christ](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.02.00-1258-ce-historical-christ-dies.md) and a Deep State census targeting giants in the Istanbul region.

2. **The [Battle of Kulikovo (1380)](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.00-1380-ce-giants-are-defeated-at-the-battle-of-kulikovo.md)** — cannon technology defeated the giants. "Royal" Christianity — the original Christianity of Christ's giant descendants — fell to Apostolic Christianity.

3. **The [Pugachev Rebellion (1773–1775)](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.02.00-1773-ce-the-rebellion-of-pugachev.md)** — the final war. Pugachev led giants and normal-sized humans against the Romanovs. His defeat, accomplished by [directed energy weapons](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md), ended giant civilisation permanently. The remaining giants were [instantly fossilised](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.05.00-1774-ce-instant-fossilization-and-electric-petrification.md) and their bones reclassified as dinosaur fossils.

## The Smithsonian Cover-Up

The [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution), founded 1846 — one generation after the MudFlood — immediately began excavating giant skeletal remains across North America. 19th-century newspaper accounts repeatedly describe giant human skeletons (7–12 feet) across the Ohio Valley, Mississippi region, and Southwest. The Smithsonian received many of these remains; none are on public display.

## Universal Giant Traditions

Velikovsky confirms: *"The traditions of peoples all over the world are quite unanimous in asserting that an earlier time a race of giants lived on the earth, that most of the race were destroyed in great catastrophes."* The Japanese [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people), the Aztec [Quinametzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinametzin), the Basque [Jentilak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jentil), the Hebrew [Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim) and [Og of Bashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og) (iron bedstead ~13.5 × 6 feet), Josephus's Amorites — the pattern repeats everywhere: giants destroyed in catastrophes, survivors exterminated by smaller humans, bones visible to later generations.

## Modern Predictive Programming

The erasure is maintained by [predictive programming](/content/15.ce-21st-the-final-struggle/15.01.00-predictive-programming-fiction-as-control.md): *Jack the Giant Killer*, *The BFG*, *Attack on Titan*, *Harry Potter*'s giants — the consistent message is that giants are dangerous and the world is better without them. *Jack and the Beanstalk* was first published in **1807, 32 years after Pugachev's defeat** — a foundational story of giant elimination written by the generation that witnessed the actual extermination.

## The Lineage from Christ to Pugachev

The thread is genealogical: Christ (Andronicus I) was a giant from Rus'. His descendants founded the Horde Empire. Three wars progressively reduced the giant population. After 1775, buildings built for giants — including European [castles](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.01-european-castles-fortresses-against-giants.md) — were abandoned. The Codex Gigas sits in the Swedish Royal Library: 36 inches tall, 165 pounds. It was not made for us.
