# The Giants of the Rus-Horde

![The Giants of the Rus-Horde](/media/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/giants-of-the-rus-horde.png)

The word **Horde** (Russian: *Orda*) has been deliberately reframed in western historiography to mean a chaotic, disorderly mob — a swarm of animals or barbarians. But as Fomenko demonstrates, it derives from the Russian word *RAT'* (рать), meaning **army**, and the country itself was called *RUTHENIA* — meaning *RATNAYA*, i.e. a **military** country. The "Mongol" in "Mongol Empire" comes from the Russian *MNOGO* (много), meaning **many** or **multitudinous**, or from the Greek *MEGALION*, meaning **great**.

> "The word HORDE is, probably, a variation of a modified Russian word RAT', meaning army. The 'ancient' and Medieval word RUTHENIA, which Rus' (Russia) was called, meant RATNAYA — MILITARY country."
> — Fomenko, [The Epoch of the XIII Century](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html)

The deliberate mistranslation of *Orda* as "horde" — conjuring images of disorderly savages — is part of a centuries-long campaign to obscure what the Rus-Horde actually was: a disciplined imperial civilization whose leadership caste appeared to be **giant, hairy humans** descending from an ancient lineage that predated modern humanity.

## The Giant Leadership of the Horde

The Rus-Horde empire was not led by normal-sized humans. Its ruling class — the descendants of the [Wild People](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) described throughout this timeline — were of enormous stature, covered in body hair, and venerated by normal-sized humans as living connections to the pre-catastrophe world. Christ himself, born of the hairy giant [Mary of Rus'](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md), was the founder of this dynasty. The [Masons](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.01-the-masons.md) who built the empire's monumental architecture worked under the direction of these giant rulers.

The giants were not merely large. They possessed knowledge systems, religious traditions, and physical capabilities that made them ungovernable by the Deep State's emerging institutions. They had their own bibles, their own chronicles, and their own matrilineal religious tradition that had nothing to do with the patriarchal Church being constructed in Rome or Constantinople.

## The Codex Gigas: A Giant's Bible

The [Codex Gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Gigas) — literally "Giant Book" (Czech: *Obří kniha*) — is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world: **92 cm (36 inches) tall**, **50 cm (20 inches) wide**, and weighing **74.8 kg (165 lbs)**. It is composed of 310 leaves of vellum said to require the skins of 160 donkeys. Created in the early 13th century at the Benedictine monastery of Podlažice in Bohemia, it contains the entire Latin Bible, Flavius Josephus's *Antiquities of the Jews* and *The Jewish War*, Isidore of Seville's encyclopedia *Etymologiae*, the chronicle of Cosmas of Prague, medical texts, and — most infamously — a full-page portrait of the Devil.

The manuscript is also known as the **Devil's Bible**, and its legend is telling:

> According to one version of a legend already recorded in the Middle Ages, the scribe was a monk who broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled up alive. To escape death, he promised to create, in one night, a book to glorify the monastery forever, including all human knowledge. Near midnight, he became so desperate that he prayed to Lucifer to help him finish the book in exchange for his soul. The Devil completed the manuscript, and the monk added the Devil's picture as a tribute.
> — [National Library of Sweden](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082419/http://www.kb.se/codex-gigas/eng/Long/)

Modern analysis confirms the manuscript was written by a single hand and estimates 20–30 years of continuous work. But the legend of supernatural overnight creation persists — because the *real* question the legend encoded was never about the Devil.

**The real question is: who was the book made for?**

A 36-inch-tall, 165-pound book is not designed for a normal-sized human. It cannot be held. It cannot be carried. It cannot be read at a desk built for an ordinary monk. The Codex Gigas was made for a **giant reader** — and the monastery that housed it served the Rus-Horde empire at the height of its expansion into Central Europe. The "Devil" depicted in the manuscript is a giant with **green skin, body hair, claws, and horns** — the demonized portrait of the very race the book was created to serve.

Notably, the first page of the Codex Gigas includes two Hebrew alphabets and slips with **Early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets** — the scripts of Rus'. The content includes Josephus's *Antiquities of the Jews*, which recounts the Genesis creation narrative — the same origin story the giants carried from the Golden Age. Twelve pages were later removed from the manuscript by unknown hands. What was on them has never been explained.

The Codex Gigas is not the only giant book. The parent article documents the [giant books](/media/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/giants_write_books.png) known to exist from this era — oversized manuscripts, oversized furniture, oversized architecture — all dismissed by conventional history as "decorative" or "ceremonial." They were neither. They were **functional objects made for giant users**.

## The Word "Horde" as Demonization

The English word *horde* entered western European languages in the 16th century, stripped of its military meaning and loaded with connotations of chaos, animality, and barbarism. This semantic shift occurred precisely when the Reformation powers were rewriting the history of the empire they had defeated.

Consider:
- The Latin *ordo* means **order** — a military order, a religious order, an ordered structure. The Teutonic Order, the Knights Hospitaller, the Jesuits — all *ordines*.
- The Russian *Orda* (Орда) is cognate with *ordo*. The Golden Horde, the Blue Horde, the White Horde — these were **ordered military structures**, not chaotic mobs.
- Western historiography inverted this: the *Horde* became a word for savage, subhuman swarms. "Mongol hordes." "Barbarian hordes."

This inversion follows the same pattern applied to every population targeted for elimination: first demonize, then destroy, then rewrite. The giants of the Horde were recast as bestial, disorderly, and subhuman — the same reframing applied to the [Wild Men and Wild Women](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) of medieval art, who were said to symbolize "sinful humanity."

## Three Wars Against the Giants

The history of the Rus-Horde empire is the history of three major wars between humans and giants, each escalating in violence and finality:

1. **The Crusade of the early 12th century** — The first organized campaign against the giant population, triggered by the [Crucifixion of Christ](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.02.00-1258-ce-historical-christ-dies.md) and the subsequent Deep State census to count and eliminate giants in the Istanbul region.

2. **The Battle of Kulikovo (1380)** — The giants of the Horde, who had dominated Eurasia for over a century, succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology of the smaller humans. In this battle, 'Royal' Christianity — the original Christianity of Christ's giant descendants — was defeated by the Apostolic Christianity we know today.

3. **The [Pugachev Rebellion](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.02.00-1773-ce-the-rebellion-of-pugachev.md) (1773–1775)** — The final war. Pugachev — identified in the NC framework as Peter III, a direct descendant of Christ and the legitimate heir to the Russian throne — led an army of giants and normal-sized humans against the Romanov dynasty. His defeat in 1775, accomplished by the deployment of [directed energy weapons](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md), ended the giant civilization permanently. The remaining giants were [instantly fossilized](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.05.00-1774-ce-instant-fossilization-and-electric-petrification.md) by the MudFlood Energetic Event and their bones later reclassified as dinosaur fossils.

## The Smithsonian Cover-Up

The [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution), founded in 1846 — within a single generation of the MudFlood event — immediately began excavating giant skeletal remains across North America. The AIAA [accused the Smithsonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_(esotericism)) of a deliberate cover-up. 19th-century newspaper accounts repeatedly describe giant human skeletons (7–12 feet tall) across the Ohio Valley, the Mississippi region, and the Southwest. The Smithsonian received many of these remains; none are on public display or in institutional catalogues. The standard explanation — that every single report across every region was misidentified megafauna, hoaxes, or exaggeration — is statistically implausible.

## Traditions of Giants in Catastrophe

Velikovsky's [unpublished research](http://saturniancosmology.org/files/vel-unpublished/giants.txt) confirms the universality of giant traditions: *"The traditions of peoples all over the world are quite unanimous in asserting that an earlier time a race of giants lived on the earth, that most of the race were destroyed in great catastrophes."* The Japanese record the [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people) — long-legged, furry giants. The Aztecs record the [Quinametzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinametzin) who built Teotihuacan. The Basque [Jentilak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jentil) — giants who held "the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians" — are credited with building megalithic structures. The Hebrew Bible records the [Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim), [Anakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakim), [Rephaites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite), and [Og, King of Bashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og), whose iron bedstead measured nine by four cubits (~13.5 × 6 feet). Josephus recorded the Amorites as giants whose "bones are still shown to this very day." The pattern repeats everywhere: the giants were destroyed in catastrophes, the survivors exterminated by smaller humans, and the bones were still visible to later generations.

## Modern Predictive Programming: Giants as Evil

The erasure of giants is maintained today by **predictive programming** in popular media. Across every medium aimed at children — *Jack the Giant Killer*, *Jack and the Beanstalk*, *The BFG*, the MCU's *Jötunn*, *Attack on Titan*, *Harry Potter*'s giant population — the message is consistent: giants are dangerous, subhuman, and the world is better without them. This is the same moral preparation that preceded every genocide in recorded history.

*Jack and the Beanstalk* — first published in 1807, **32 years after the defeat of Pugachev** — is the foundational children's story of giant elimination: a small human steals the giants' wealth and kills the giant. The audience cheers. This story was written in the generation that witnessed the actual extermination of the last giant civilization.

## The Lineage from Christ to Pugachev

The thread is genealogical: Christ (Andronicus I, per Fomenko) was a giant from Rus'. His descendants founded the Rus-Horde Empire. The giant lineage ruled through Imperial Christianity. Three wars of extermination — the Crusades, the [Battle of Kulikovo](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.00-1380-ce-giants-are-defeated-at-the-battle-of-kulikovo.md), and the [Pugachev Rebellion](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.02.00-1773-ce-the-rebellion-of-pugachev.md) — progressively reduced the giant population. After Pugachev's 1775 defeat, the giants were eliminated by the [MudFlood](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md), their bones reclassified, and their existence converted into fairy tales. European [castles](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.01-european-castles-fortresses-against-giants.md) — built during the peak era of giant activity and abandoned once they were gone — preserve the architectural evidence of this coexistence.

The Codex Gigas sits in the Swedish Royal Library: 36 inches tall, 165 pounds. It cannot be held by a single person. It was not made for us.
