# The Giants of the Rus-Horde

![The Giants of the Rus-Horde](/media/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/giants-of-the-rus-horde.png)

The word **Horde** (Russian: *Orda*) has been deliberately reframed in western historiography to mean a chaotic, disorderly mob — a swarm of animals or barbarians. But as Fomenko demonstrates, it derives from the Russian word *RAT'* (рать), meaning **army**, and the country itself was called *RUTHENIA* — meaning *RATNAYA*, i.e. a **military** country. The "Mongol" in "Mongol Empire" comes from the Russian *MNOGO* (много), meaning **many** or **multitudinous**, or from the Greek *MEGALION*, meaning **great**.

> "The word HORDE is, probably, a variation of a modified Russian word RAT', meaning army. The 'ancient' and Medieval word RUTHENIA, which Rus' (Russia) was called, meant RATNAYA — MILITARY country."
> — Fomenko, [The Epoch of the XIII Century](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html)

The deliberate mistranslation of *Orda* as "horde" — conjuring images of disorderly savages — is part of a centuries-long campaign to obscure what the Rus-Horde actually was: a disciplined imperial civilization whose leadership caste appeared to be **giant, hairy humans** descending from an ancient lineage that predated modern humanity.

## The Giant Leadership of the Horde

The Rus-Horde empire was not led by normal-sized humans. Its ruling class — the descendants of the [Wild People](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) described throughout this timeline — were of enormous stature, covered in body hair, and venerated by normal-sized humans as living connections to the pre-catastrophe world. Christ himself, born of the hairy giant [Mary of Rus'](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md), was the founder of this dynasty. The [Masons](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.01-the-masons.md) who built the empire's monumental architecture worked under the direction of these giant rulers.

The giants were not merely large. They possessed knowledge systems, religious traditions, and physical capabilities that made them ungovernable by the Deep State's emerging institutions. They had their own bibles, their own chronicles, and their own matrilineal religious tradition that had nothing to do with the patriarchal Church being constructed in Rome or Constantinople.

## The Codex Gigas: A Giant's Bible

The [Codex Gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Gigas) — literally "Giant Book" (Czech: *Obří kniha*) — is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world: **92 cm (36 inches) tall**, **50 cm (20 inches) wide**, and weighing **74.8 kg (165 lbs)**. It is composed of 310 leaves of vellum said to require the skins of 160 donkeys. Created in the early 13th century at the Benedictine monastery of Podlažice in Bohemia, it contains the entire Latin Bible, Flavius Josephus's *Antiquities of the Jews* and *The Jewish War*, Isidore of Seville's encyclopedia *Etymologiae*, the chronicle of Cosmas of Prague, medical texts, and — most infamously — a full-page portrait of the Devil.

The manuscript is also known as the **Devil's Bible**, and its legend is telling:

> According to one version of a legend already recorded in the Middle Ages, the scribe was a monk who broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled up alive. To escape death, he promised to create, in one night, a book to glorify the monastery forever, including all human knowledge. Near midnight, he became so desperate that he prayed to Lucifer to help him finish the book in exchange for his soul. The Devil completed the manuscript, and the monk added the Devil's picture as a tribute.
> — [National Library of Sweden](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082419/http://www.kb.se/codex-gigas/eng/Long/)

Modern analysis confirms the manuscript was written by a single hand and estimates 20–30 years of continuous work. But the legend of supernatural overnight creation persists — because the *real* question the legend encoded was never about the Devil.

**The real question is: who was the book made for?**

A 36-inch-tall, 165-pound book is not designed for a normal-sized human. It cannot be held. It cannot be carried. It cannot be read at a desk built for an ordinary monk. The Codex Gigas was made for a **giant reader** — and the monastery that housed it served the Rus-Horde empire at the height of its expansion into Central Europe. The "Devil" depicted in the manuscript is a giant with **green skin, body hair, claws, and horns** — the demonized portrait of the very race the book was created to serve.

Notably, the first page of the Codex Gigas includes two Hebrew alphabets and slips with **Early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets** — the scripts of Rus'. The content includes Josephus's *Antiquities of the Jews*, which recounts the Genesis creation narrative — the same origin story the giants carried from the Golden Age. Twelve pages were later removed from the manuscript by unknown hands. What was on them has never been explained.

The Codex Gigas is not the only giant book. The parent article documents the [giant books](/media/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/giants_write_books.png) known to exist from this era — oversized manuscripts, oversized furniture, oversized architecture — all dismissed by conventional history as "decorative" or "ceremonial." They were neither. They were **functional objects made for giant users**.

## The Word "Horde" as Demonization

The English word *horde* entered western European languages in the 16th century, stripped of its military meaning and loaded with connotations of chaos, animality, and barbarism. This semantic shift occurred precisely when the Reformation powers were rewriting the history of the empire they had defeated.

Consider:
- The Latin *ordo* means **order** — a military order, a religious order, an ordered structure. The Teutonic Order, the Knights Hospitaller, the Jesuits — all *ordines*.
- The Russian *Orda* (Орда) is cognate with *ordo*. The Golden Horde, the Blue Horde, the White Horde — these were **ordered military structures**, not chaotic mobs.
- Western historiography inverted this: the *Horde* became a word for savage, subhuman swarms. "Mongol hordes." "Barbarian hordes."

This inversion follows the same pattern applied to every population targeted for elimination: first demonize, then destroy, then rewrite. The giants of the Horde were recast as bestial, disorderly, and subhuman — the same reframing applied to the [Wild Men and Wild Women](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.01.01-hairy-mary.md) of medieval art, who were said to symbolize "sinful humanity."

## Three Wars Against the Giants

The history of the Rus-Horde empire is the history of three major wars between humans and giants, each escalating in violence and finality:

1. **The Crusade of the early 12th century** — The first organized campaign against the giant population, triggered by the [Crucifixion of Christ](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.02.00-1258-ce-historical-christ-dies.md) and the subsequent Deep State census to count and eliminate giants in the Istanbul region.

2. **The Battle of Kulikovo (1380)** — The giants of the Horde, who had dominated Eurasia for over a century, succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology of the smaller humans. In this battle, 'Royal' Christianity — the original Christianity of Christ's giant descendants — was defeated by the Apostolic Christianity we know today.

3. **The [Pugachev Rebellion](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.02.00-1773-ce-the-rebellion-of-pugachev.md) (1773–1775)** — The final war. Pugachev — identified in the NC framework as Peter III, a direct descendant of Christ and the legitimate heir to the Russian throne — led an army of giants and normal-sized humans against the Romanov dynasty. His defeat in 1775, accomplished by the deployment of [directed energy weapons](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md), ended the giant civilization permanently. The remaining giants were [instantly fossilized](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.05.00-1774-ce-instant-fossilization-and-electric-petrification.md) by the MudFlood Energetic Event and their bones later reclassified as dinosaur fossils.

## The Smithsonian Cover-Up

The [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution), founded in 1846 — within a single generation of the MudFlood event — immediately began the systematic excavation and reclassification of giant skeletal remains across North America.

The American Institution of Alternative Archaeology (AIAA) [accused the Smithsonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_(esotericism)) of a deliberate cover-up: destroying or suppressing giant bones to protect the conventional Darwinian narrative of human evolution. The accusation was "debunked" by mainstream media — the standard response to any claim that threatens the managed timeline. But the pattern is undeniable:

- **19th-century American newspaper accounts** repeatedly describe the discovery of giant human skeletons — 7 to 12 feet tall — across the Ohio Valley, the Mississippi region, and the American Southwest. These reports are [well-documented in period archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_(mythology)#Archeology_and_paleontology).
- The Smithsonian, *by its own later admission*, received many of these remains. None are on public display. None appear in institutional catalogues.
- The standard explanation — that all giant bone reports were misidentified megafauna, hoaxes, or journalistic exaggeration — requires that *every single report* across *every region* was wrong. This is statistically implausible.

The Smithsonian's founding mandate was to "increase and diffuse knowledge." What it actually increased and diffused was the managed narrative: giants never existed, dinosaurs died 65 million years ago, and human evolution follows a single Darwinian gradient from small to modern. Every bone that contradicted this story was either reclassified or disappeared.

## Traditions of Giants in Catastrophe

The [Saturnian Cosmology](http://saturniancosmology.org/files/vel-unpublished/giants.txt) archive, preserved in the wget mirror, records Velikovsky's unpublished research on the universality of giant traditions:

> "The traditions of peoples all over the world are quite unanimous in asserting that an earlier time a race of giants lived on the earth, that most of the race were destroyed in great catastrophes; that they were of cruel nature and were furiously fighting among themselves; that the last of them were exterminated when after a cataclysm a migration of peoples brought the forebears of the peoples of today to their new homelands."

The Japanese record **long-legged, furry giants** called the [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people) who inhabited the islands before the arrival of the Japanese forefathers after a great catastrophe. The Aztec tradition records the [Quinametzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinametzin), a race of giants who built Teotihuacan and were destroyed in cataclysms. The Basque [Jentilak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jentil) — giants who "stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity" — are credited with building megalithic structures and held "the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians."

The Hebrew Bible records the [Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim), the [Anakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakim), the [Rephaites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite), and — most significantly — [Og, King of Bashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og), whose iron bedstead measured **nine cubits by four cubits** (approximately 13.5 × 6 feet). The text of Deuteronomy implies that this bedstead "is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?" — a physical artifact still on display at the time of writing. Josephus recorded the Amorites as giants whose "bones are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men."

But everywhere the pattern repeats: the giants were destroyed in catastrophes. The survivors were exterminated by smaller humans. And the *bones were still visible* to later generations — who required explanations for what they were looking at.

## Modern Predictive Programming: Giants as Evil

The erasure of giants from official history is maintained today not just by institutional suppression but by **predictive programming** — the systematic embedding of narratives in popular media that precondition audiences to reject or fear certain ideas.

In film, television, and literature produced for the youngest audiences, giants are consistently depicted as:

- **Evil and must be destroyed**: *Jack the Giant Killer*, *Jack and the Beanstalk*, *Jack the Giant Slayer* (2013)
- **Stupid, violent ogres**: *The BFG* (Roald Dahl) — even the "Big Friendly Giant" is the exception that proves the rule; his fellow giants are man-eating brutes
- **Chaotic antagonists**: The *Jötunn* of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (*Thor*, 2011), the giants of *Game of Thrones*, the Titans of *Attack on Titan* (2013–2023) — towering humanoids who eat people and must be destroyed to save civilization
- **Monsters to be controlled**: The [giants of Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid) — where the half-giant Hagrid is lovable but his full-giant mother is a violent outcast, and the giant population is manipulated as expendable weapons in a wizarding war
- **Mindless destroyers**: *Pacific Rim* (2013), *Godzilla* franchise, *Clash of the Titans*

The message transmitted to children aged 3–12 across every medium is: **giants are dangerous, subhuman, and the world is better without them.** This is not a coincidence. It is the same moral preparation that preceded every genocide in recorded history: demonize the target population, make their destruction seem natural and necessary, and train the next generation to accept their absence as normal.

The fairy tale *Jack and the Beanstalk* — first published in 1807, **32 years after the defeat of Pugachev** — is the foundational children's story of giant elimination: a small, clever human climbs into the world of the giants, steals their wealth (a golden harp, a goose that lays golden eggs), and kills the giant by chopping down the beanstalk. The giant falls to his death. Jack becomes rich. The audience cheers.

This story was written in the generation that witnessed the actual extermination of the last giant civilization on Earth.

## The Lineage from Christ to Pugachev

The thread running through this entire timeline section is genealogical:

- **Christ** ([Andronicus I Comnenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronicus_I_Comnenus), per Fomenko) was a giant — a hairy human from Rus', descended from the antediluvian giant civilization that survived the Dark Ages
- His descendants founded the **Rus-Horde Empire** in the 13th century, establishing the largest contiguous empire in human history
- The giant lineage ruled through the **Imperial / Royal Christianity** that preceded and opposed the Latin Church
- The three wars of giant extermination — the Crusades, the Battle of Kulikovo, and the Pugachev Rebellion — progressively reduced the giant population
- **Pugachev** (1773–1775), the last giant claimant to the throne, represented the final opportunity to restore the original order
- After his defeat, the giants were eliminated by the [MudFlood](/content/12.ce-18th-mudflood-and-pugachev/12.04.00-1774-ce-the-mudflood-and-world-cataclysm.md), their bones reclassified, their history rewritten, and their existence converted into fairy tales designed to make the next generation believe giants were never real

The Codex Gigas — the Giant Book — sits in the Swedish Royal Library in Stockholm, 36 inches tall and 165 pounds heavy. It cannot be lifted by a single person. It cannot be read at a normal desk. It was not made for us. It was made for *them* — and the Devil painted on its pages is the last portrait of the race that created it, drawn by the civilization that replaced them.
