# The Masons: Imperial Builders of the Rus-Horde Empire

The Freemasons themselves admit they do not know their own origin. What they *do* know is that their fraternity
emerged from stonemasons' guilds of the Middle Ages, that their oldest known document dates to 1390, and that it
was already a *copy* of something older. Their central mythos — the building of Solomon's Temple, the murder of
the master architect Hiram Abiff, the sacred geometry of the lodge — all point backward to an era of monumental
construction directed by a single imperial authority.

Per Fomenko's reconstruction, that authority was the Rus-Horde Empire. And the 13th century is when it began.

## "Destroy This Temple, and in Three Days I Will Raise It Up"

Christ's famous declaration (John 2:19) is treated by the church as metaphor — he was speaking of his body, they
say. But the historical Andronicus-Christ of the 12th century was a *prince*, not merely a preacher. His words
carried the weight of imperial command. Fomenko identifies the
["destruction of the temple and its rebuilding in three days"](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_26.html)
as one of the core historical storylines shared between Christ and the Prophet Muhammad — not theology, but a
commission recorded by multiple civilizations.

If Solomon's Temple is
[Hagia Sophia in Constantinople](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_11.html) — as Fomenko demonstrates,
identifying King Solomon with Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and the Temple of Solomon with the great cathedral
of Czar-Grad — then the "rebuilding" Christ spoke of was not metaphorical resurrection but *architectural
reconstruction*. The command to rebuild the temple became the founding mandate of a monumental building program
that would span the entire empire.

## The Eight Wonders: One Empire, One Building Program

Fomenko's [reconstruction of the XIV–XVI century](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_10.html) places all
of the world's most spectacular "ancient" constructions within the same 200-year window, under the same political
authority:

1. **The Great Wall of China**
2. **The magnificent cathedrals of Western Europe**
3. **The indomitable Kremlins and fortifications of Russia-Horde**
4. **Hagia Sophia in Istanbul** (= Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem = Czar-Grad)
5. **The Great Sphinx**
6. **The Great Pyramids and temples of Egypt**
7. **The great pyramids and temples of Central America** (Mexico)
8. **The gigantic constructions of Baalbek** (Lebanon)

> "The Great Pyramids naturally fit in the epoch of the monumental constructions, which blossomed in the XIV–XVI
> cc. all over the Empire."
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, [ch. 4.10](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_10.html)

All eight required the same specialized knowledge: geopolymer cement, megalithic stone-fitting, advanced geometry,
and logistical coordination across continents. This was not coincidence. It was a *program* — directed from the
center of the empire and executed by a class of specialists dispatched to the provinces.

## The Cathars: Scythian Builder-Colonizers

Who were these specialists? Fomenko identifies them as the
[Cathars — the Scythians of the Volga river](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html):

> "The Cathars are the Scythians of the Volga river, who came to France in the XIV c. from Russia-Horde during
> the 'Mongol' conquest. They settled down here and, as the colonizers, created the ruling class. Their religion
> was Christian."

> "In the epoch of the Empire of the XIV–XVI cc. the Cathars = Scythians, having partially mixed with the local
> population, created a unique culture, **built the cities, cathedrals, fortresses**, some of which are still
> called Cathar."

The Cathars were not merely religious dissidents — they were the *builders*. Christian colonizers dispatched from
the empire's heartland, they constructed the Gothic cathedrals, the fortified cities, and the mountain castles
that still dot southern France. Their "heresy" was not theological innovation but the original imperial
Christianity of the Rus-Horde, later declared heretical by the Reformation-era Catholic Church that supplanted it.

## Gothic = Goth = Hordian: The Uniform Style Explained

Why does Gothic architecture look the same from Cologne to Constantinople? Because it originated from a
[single source](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_30.html):

> "The style of temples which today are known as 'gothic' are based on the architecture of the old Russian-Horde
> cathedrals of the XIV–XVI cc... They were modelled on the cathedrals of the metropoly, i.e. Russia-Horde...
> Following the split of a united Christianity into several branches these architectural styles began to be
> considered independent. It is not true. They date back to the mutual Hordian source."

After the
[Reformation broke the empire apart](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html),
the new Western European states kept the Gothic style but erased its origin:

> "The Western reformers who came to power decided to preserve the Gothic architectural style of the 'Mongol'
> temples in their own new buildings, having only declared it to be ancient and exclusively their own, allegedly
> purely Western-European."

The word "Gothic" itself is the clue. The Goths *were* the Horde. Gothic architecture is Hordian architecture,
renamed by the victors.

## The Master-Builders: Sworn to Secrecy, Silenced Forever

The empire's architects operated under extreme secrecy. When Italian architects — themselves working within the
"Mongol" Empire's provincial structure — were
[summoned to build Moscow](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_35.html) as the Second Jerusalem, they were
never allowed to leave:

> "ALL THE THREE ARCHITECTS COULD NOT LEAVE MOSCOW AND HAD TO LAY THEIR BONES THERE... This idiosyncratic
> triumvirate of the Moscow Kremlin (Aristotele Fioravanti, Solarius and Aloisio) was the bearer of its innermost
> secrets... To let even one of this glorious trio back to Europe would have been almost equivalent to making
> Moscow's innermost secrets the subject of malicious gossip."

> "On the completion of building, the chief architects, who knew the scheme of the underground Moscow, could be
> silenced for ever, so they could tell no one."

This is the proto-Masonic structure: an itinerant class of initiated builders, Christian in religion, working
under imperial commission, possessing graded levels of specialized knowledge — and bound by oaths of secrecy
enforced by death. The Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff, the master architect of Solomon's Temple who was murdered
for refusing to reveal the secrets of his craft, is a *memory* of these imperial builders who "had to lay their
bones" in Moscow.

## Baalbek and the Geopolymer Secret

The master-builders carried knowledge that modern construction cannot replicate. At Baalbek, stones weighing over
1,000 tons were fitted with sub-millimeter precision. Fomenko identifies the
[builders](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html):

> "Baalbek was built in the 'ancient' epoch of the XV–XVI cc. by the Horde craftsmen. Aka the 'ancient Roman'
> master-builders. At that time all similar constructions were erected by the 'Mongol' Empire."

The secret was geopolymer cement — artificial stone cast in place:

> "In each case the master-builders selected a special artificial stone. In some cases they made artificial
> limestone, in other — artificial granite, synthetic basalt or synthetic diorite."

This is why the stones fit so perfectly: they were not carved and transported but *poured* on site. The knowledge
of geopolymer cement was one of the master-builders' most closely guarded trade secrets — and one reason they
could not be allowed to leave.

## Freemasonry and Catharism: Branches of the Same Tree

Wal Thornhill's [synthesis](https://www.saturniancosmology.org) of suppressed traditions lists among the
Christian "heresies" destroyed by the Reformation:

> "gnosticism, philosophy, hermeticism, alchemy, Manichaeism, qabbala, astrology, **Freemasonry, catharism**"

Freemasonry and Catharism appear side by side — not as unrelated movements but as branches of the same
suppressed imperial tradition. The Cathars were the *operative* masons: the actual builders who constructed the
empire's monuments. Freemasonry is what survived after the builders lost their patron. The rituals preserved the
memory; the knowledge of actual construction was gradually lost.

The [dragonkeypress flood tradition](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/files/flood/dragonkeypress.txt) connects
Masonic ritual directly to catastrophe mythology. In the "Prince of the Tabernacle" ceremony an "Ark" is
processed around the room said to contain "the organs of generation of Osiris." The Masonic password "Tubal-Cain"
— Noah's descendant credited with inventing metallurgy — ties the order's foundation myth to the post-flood
rebuilding of civilization. The Kabeiroi initiations at Thebes and Samothrace, documented in de Grazia's *Ka*,
combined metallurgical knowledge with graded initiation rites — the same structure that would later characterize
the stonemasons' guilds.

## The Reformation: Masons Become "Freemasons"

The original Masons were *operative* builders — men who could pour geopolymer, raise Gothic cathedrals, and
engineer underground cities. Their religion was the polytheistic Christianity of the Rus-Horde Empire, in which
Christ was a historical prince and the saints were the old gods under new names. There was no "Supreme Being" in
the abstract Deist sense — there were *gods*, plural, and the builders worked under their commission.

The Reformation changed everything. As Fomenko documents, the
[Reformation was not a protest against the Catholic Church in Rome](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_19.html) —
it was a revolt against the *Greek Orthodox authority of the Rus-Horde Empire*:

> "In the late XVI century in Europe there appears a centrifugal tendency, reinforced by the deep seated
> resentment towards the Russian-Horde authorities... These feelings erupted into a major rebellion in the West.
> The epoch of the Reformation and Protestantism begins."
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, [ch. 6.19](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_19.html)

The "Protestants" were not protesting the Pope. They were protesting the *Khan*. The entire framing of
the Reformation as a Catholic–Protestant doctrinal dispute is a post-hoc redaction that conceals the real
conflict: Western provincial governors breaking away from the Hordian Empire and seizing its territories,
treasuries, and — crucially — its *builders*.

When the empire collapsed, the Cathar-Scythian builder class was annihilated or absorbed. The new Western
states permitted the guilds to survive but only after thorough rebranding. The operative Masons of the Rus-Horde
became the *speculative* "Freemasons" of Protestant Europe. Polytheism was replaced with Monotheistic prayer to
the **GAOTU** (Great Architect of the Universe) — the very name preserving the builders' memory while stripping
its polytheistic content. Building knowledge was replaced with ritual: the tools — compass, square, level — became
symbols rather than instruments, and the trade secrets (geopolymer formulas, underground engineering) were lost.
Imperial loyalty was replaced with secrecy — the Freemasons hid not because their knowledge was dangerous but
because their very existence was a remnant of the empire the Reformation had destroyed.

## The Illuminati and the New Capitals

In 1776, the [Bavarian Illuminati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati) were founded the same year as the
American Declaration of Independence. The Freemasons were recruited to construct three replacement capitals for
the old Hordian centers: **Washington, D.C.** (laid out by Freemason architects, Capitol cornerstone laid in
Masonic regalia, incorporating pentagrams and obelisks); **the City of London** (rebuilt after the 1666 Great
Fire under Masonic influence as the financial capital, housing the
[stolen treasury of the Empire](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html)); and **Vatican City**
(St. Peter's completed 1626, obelisk re-erected 1586 by the Jesuits who had
[redacted Christianity](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md)).

All three share the same architectural vocabulary: **obelisks** (Hordian burial markers), **domes** (modeled on
Hagia Sophia), **columns** (Hordian provincial style), and **spires** that echo the polar configuration of the
[Golden Age](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.00.00-4077-bce-the-golden-age.md) — pointing toward a sky that no longer
exists. The [British Empire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.06.00-1583-ce-the-british-empire-as-deep-state-instrument.md) would later use all three capitals as nodes of Deep State control, with [Latin](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.00-language-of-the-deep-state.md) — a language the British never spoke — as their shared ceremonial tongue.

## Freemasonry in America

Michael A. Hoffman II (*Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare*, 2001; [2019 interview](https://rielpolitik.com/2019/08/16/secret-societies-the-alchemical-processing-of-humanity-through-public-psychodrama-an-interview-with-michael-hoffman/)) traces a pipeline from Florentine Neoplatonists (Ficino, Pico della Mirandola) through the Medici papacies to British Freemasonry — arguing that Catholic and Protestant occult traditions were not opposites but **symbiotic rivals** promoting the same model of secret-society governance. In America, Freemasonry captured the Founding by promising transcendence of sectarian violence, while operationally institutionalising "rule by the secrets-keepers" — suborning courts, embedding lodge language into everyday speech ("on the level," "square dealer"), and connecting figures like Benjamin Franklin to the [Hellfire Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellfire_Club).

The first major resistance came in 1826 when [William Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_(anti-Mason)) published *The Three Degrees of Freemasonry* and was kidnapped and drowned by Masons — provoking a national anti-Masonic movement led by former President [John Quincy Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams). Hoffman also identifies the [KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) as a Masonic organisation and notes the Confederacy was "far more Masonic" under [Albert Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pike). By 2004, both presidential candidates (Kerry, Bush) were [Skull & Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones) initiates — the cryptocracy controlling both sides. Freemasonry is now "on the eclipse," Hoffman observes, not because it failed but because it accomplished its objectives.

## The Great Irony

The Freemasons claim descent from the builders of Solomon's Temple, the Pyramids, and the Gothic cathedrals — structures they had nothing to do with. The original Masons (Cathar-Scythian master-builders) constructed the Gothic cathedrals, the Kremlins, the Great Pyramids, the pyramids of Central America, Baalbek, Hagia Sophia, the Great Wall, and the underground cities of Moscow and Cappadocia. The Freemasons, by contrast, built government buildings, lodges, and memorials — competent neoclassical structures without megalithic ambition. They inherited the name, the symbols, and the organizational structure, but not the knowledge, not the materials science, and not the imperial patron.
