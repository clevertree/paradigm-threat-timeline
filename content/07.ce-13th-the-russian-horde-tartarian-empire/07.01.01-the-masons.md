# The Masons: Imperial Builders of the Rus-Horde Empire

> "No one knows with certainty how or when the Masonic Fraternity was formed."

The Freemasons admit they do not know their own origin. Their oldest document (the Regius Poem, c. 1390) was already a *copy* of something older. Their central mythos — Solomon's Temple, the murdered master architect Hiram Abiff, the sacred geometry of the lodge — all point to an era of monumental construction under a single imperial authority. Per Fomenko, that authority was the Rus-Horde Empire.

## The Temple Commission

Christ's declaration "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2:19) is one of the core storylines shared between Christ and Muhammad — not theology, but a [commission recorded by multiple civilizations](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_26.html). If Solomon's Temple is [Hagia Sophia](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_11.html) — as Fomenko demonstrates, identifying King Solomon with Sultan Suleiman — then the "rebuilding" was *architectural reconstruction*, launching a monumental building programme spanning the entire empire.

## One Empire, One Building Programme

Fomenko places all of the world's most spectacular "ancient" constructions within the same [200-year window (XIV–XVI cc.)](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_10.html), under the same authority: the Great Wall of China, the Gothic cathedrals of Western Europe, Russian Kremlins, Hagia Sophia, the Great Sphinx, the pyramids and temples of Egypt and Central America, and the gigantic constructions of Baalbek. All required the same specialised knowledge — geopolymer cement, megalithic stone-fitting, advanced geometry, continental logistics. This was a *programme*, not coincidence.

## The Cathars: Scythian Builder-Colonisers

Fomenko identifies the builders as the [Cathars — Scythians of the Volga](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html) who came to France during the "Mongol" conquest. They were not religious dissidents but *operative builders*: Christian colonisers dispatched from the Horde heartland who constructed Gothic cathedrals, fortified cities, and mountain castles. Their "heresy" was the original imperial Christianity, later declared heretical by the Reformation-era Catholic Church.

## Gothic = Goth = Hordian

Why does Gothic architecture look the same from Cologne to Constantinople? Because it originated from a [single Hordian source](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_30.html). After the Reformation, the new Western states kept the style but erased its origin, declaring it "ancient and exclusively their own." The word "Gothic" is the clue — the Goths *were* the Horde.

## Sworn to Secrecy, Silenced Forever

The empire's architects operated under extreme secrecy. Italian architects [summoned to build Moscow](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_35.html) as the Second Jerusalem were never allowed to leave — *"all three architects could not leave Moscow and had to lay their bones there."* This is the proto-Masonic structure: itinerant initiated builders, working under imperial commission, bound by death oaths. The Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff — murdered for refusing to reveal craft secrets — is a *memory* of these builders.

## Geopolymer and the Construction Secret

At Baalbek, stones over 1,000 tons were fitted with sub-millimeter precision. The secret was [geopolymer cement](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html) — artificial stone cast in place. The stones fit perfectly because they were *poured*, not carved and transported. This knowledge was the master-builders' most closely guarded secret.

## From Operative to Speculative

The original Masons were *operative* builders who could pour geopolymer and raise Gothic cathedrals. Their religion was the polytheistic Christianity of the Rus-Horde. The [Reformation](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_19.html) was not a protest against the Pope but against the *Khan* — Western governors breaking from the Hordian Empire, seizing its territories and its *builders*.

When the empire collapsed, the Cathar-Scythian builder class was annihilated or absorbed. Operative Masons became *speculative* "Freemasons." Polytheism became Monotheistic prayer to the **GAOTU** (Great Architect of the Universe) — the name preserving the builders' memory while stripping its content. Tools became symbols; trade secrets were lost. The Freemasons hid not because their knowledge was dangerous but because their existence was a remnant of the empire the Reformation had destroyed.

## The Replacement Capitals

The Freemasons were recruited to construct three replacement capitals for the old Hordian centres: **Washington, D.C.** (Masonic architects, pentagrams, obelisks); **the City of London** (rebuilt after 1666 as the financial capital, housing the [stolen treasury](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html)); and **Vatican City** (St. Peter's 1626, obelisk 1586). All three share the same architectural vocabulary — obelisks, domes, columns, spires — echoing a sky that no longer exists. The [British Empire](/content/11.ce-17th-romanovs-rise-to-power/11.06.00-1583-ce-the-british-empire-as-deep-state-instrument.md) would use all three as nodes of Deep State control, with [Latin](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.00-language-of-the-deep-state.md) as their shared ceremonial tongue.
