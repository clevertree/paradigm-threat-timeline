# The Masons: Imperial Builders of the Rus-Horde Empire

The Freemasons themselves admit they do not know their own origin. What they *do* know is that their fraternity
emerged from stonemasons' guilds of the Middle Ages, that their oldest known document dates to 1390, and that it
was already a *copy* of something older. Their central mythos — the building of Solomon's Temple, the murder of
the master architect Hiram Abiff, the sacred geometry of the lodge — all point backward to an era of monumental
construction directed by a single imperial authority.

Per Fomenko's reconstruction, that authority was the Rus-Horde Empire. And the 13th century is when it began.

## "Destroy This Temple, and in Three Days I Will Raise It Up"

Christ's famous declaration (John 2:19) is treated by the church as metaphor — he was speaking of his body, they
say. But the historical Andronicus-Christ of the 12th century was a *prince*, not merely a preacher. His words
carried the weight of imperial command. Fomenko identifies the
["destruction of the temple and its rebuilding in three days"](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_26.html)
as one of the core historical storylines shared between Christ and the Prophet Muhammad — not theology, but a
commission recorded by multiple civilizations.

If Solomon's Temple is
[Hagia Sophia in Constantinople](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_11.html) — as Fomenko demonstrates,
identifying King Solomon with Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and the Temple of Solomon with the great cathedral
of Czar-Grad — then the "rebuilding" Christ spoke of was not metaphorical resurrection but *architectural
reconstruction*. The command to rebuild the temple became the founding mandate of a monumental building program
that would span the entire empire.

## The Eight Wonders: One Empire, One Building Program

Fomenko's [reconstruction of the XIV–XVI century](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_10.html) places all
of the world's most spectacular "ancient" constructions within the same 200-year window, under the same political
authority:

1. **The Great Wall of China**
2. **The magnificent cathedrals of Western Europe**
3. **The indomitable Kremlins and fortifications of Russia-Horde**
4. **Hagia Sophia in Istanbul** (= Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem = Czar-Grad)
5. **The Great Sphinx**
6. **The Great Pyramids and temples of Egypt**
7. **The great pyramids and temples of Central America** (Mexico)
8. **The gigantic constructions of Baalbek** (Lebanon)

> "The Great Pyramids naturally fit in the epoch of the monumental constructions, which blossomed in the XIV–XVI
> cc. all over the Empire."
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, [ch. 4.10](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_10.html)

All eight required the same specialized knowledge: geopolymer cement, megalithic stone-fitting, advanced geometry,
and logistical coordination across continents. This was not coincidence. It was a *program* — directed from the
center of the empire and executed by a class of specialists dispatched to the provinces.

## The Cathars: Scythian Builder-Colonizers

Who were these specialists? Fomenko identifies them as the
[Cathars — the Scythians of the Volga river](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html):

> "The Cathars are the Scythians of the Volga river, who came to France in the XIV c. from Russia-Horde during
> the 'Mongol' conquest. They settled down here and, as the colonizers, created the ruling class. Their religion
> was Christian."

> "In the epoch of the Empire of the XIV–XVI cc. the Cathars = Scythians, having partially mixed with the local
> population, created a unique culture, **built the cities, cathedrals, fortresses**, some of which are still
> called Cathar."

The Cathars were not merely religious dissidents — they were the *builders*. Christian colonizers dispatched from
the empire's heartland, they constructed the Gothic cathedrals, the fortified cities, and the mountain castles
that still dot southern France. Their "heresy" was not theological innovation but the original imperial
Christianity of the Rus-Horde, later declared heretical by the Reformation-era Catholic Church that supplanted it.

## Gothic = Goth = Hordian: The Uniform Style Explained

Why does Gothic architecture look the same from Cologne to Constantinople? Because it originated from a
[single source](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_30.html):

> "The style of temples which today are known as 'gothic' are based on the architecture of the old Russian-Horde
> cathedrals of the XIV–XVI cc... They were modelled on the cathedrals of the metropoly, i.e. Russia-Horde...
> Following the split of a united Christianity into several branches these architectural styles began to be
> considered independent. It is not true. They date back to the mutual Hordian source."

After the
[Reformation broke the empire apart](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html),
the new Western European states kept the Gothic style but erased its origin:

> "The Western reformers who came to power decided to preserve the Gothic architectural style of the 'Mongol'
> temples in their own new buildings, having only declared it to be ancient and exclusively their own, allegedly
> purely Western-European."

The word "Gothic" itself is the clue. The Goths *were* the Horde. Gothic architecture is Hordian architecture,
renamed by the victors.

## The Master-Builders: Sworn to Secrecy, Silenced Forever

The empire's architects operated under extreme secrecy. When Italian architects — themselves working within the
"Mongol" Empire's provincial structure — were
[summoned to build Moscow](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_35.html) as the Second Jerusalem, they were
never allowed to leave:

> "ALL THE THREE ARCHITECTS COULD NOT LEAVE MOSCOW AND HAD TO LAY THEIR BONES THERE... This idiosyncratic
> triumvirate of the Moscow Kremlin (Aristotele Fioravanti, Solarius and Aloisio) was the bearer of its innermost
> secrets... To let even one of this glorious trio back to Europe would have been almost equivalent to making
> Moscow's innermost secrets the subject of malicious gossip."

> "On the completion of building, the chief architects, who knew the scheme of the underground Moscow, could be
> silenced for ever, so they could tell no one."

This is the proto-Masonic structure: an itinerant class of initiated builders, Christian in religion, working
under imperial commission, possessing graded levels of specialized knowledge — and bound by oaths of secrecy
enforced by death. The Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff, the master architect of Solomon's Temple who was murdered
for refusing to reveal the secrets of his craft, is a *memory* of these imperial builders who "had to lay their
bones" in Moscow.

## Baalbek and the Geopolymer Secret

The master-builders carried knowledge that modern construction cannot replicate. At Baalbek, stones weighing over
1,000 tons were fitted with sub-millimeter precision. Fomenko identifies the
[builders](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html):

> "Baalbek was built in the 'ancient' epoch of the XV–XVI cc. by the Horde craftsmen. Aka the 'ancient Roman'
> master-builders. At that time all similar constructions were erected by the 'Mongol' Empire."

The secret was geopolymer cement — artificial stone cast in place:

> "In each case the master-builders selected a special artificial stone. In some cases they made artificial
> limestone, in other — artificial granite, synthetic basalt or synthetic diorite."

This is why the stones fit so perfectly: they were not carved and transported but *poured* on site. The knowledge
of geopolymer cement was one of the master-builders' most closely guarded trade secrets — and one reason they
could not be allowed to leave.

## Freemasonry and Catharism: Branches of the Same Tree

Wal Thornhill's [synthesis](https://www.saturniancosmology.org) of suppressed traditions lists among the
Christian "heresies" destroyed by the Reformation:

> "gnosticism, philosophy, hermeticism, alchemy, Manichaeism, qabbala, astrology, **Freemasonry, catharism**"

Freemasonry and Catharism appear side by side — not as unrelated movements but as branches of the same
suppressed imperial tradition. The Cathars were the *operative* masons: the actual builders who constructed the
empire's monuments. Freemasonry is what survived after the builders lost their patron. The rituals preserved the
memory; the knowledge of actual construction was gradually lost.

The [dragonkeypress flood tradition](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/files/flood/dragonkeypress.txt) connects
Masonic ritual directly to catastrophe mythology. In the "Prince of the Tabernacle" ceremony an "Ark" is
processed around the room said to contain "the organs of generation of Osiris." The Masonic password "Tubal-Cain"
— Noah's descendant credited with inventing metallurgy — ties the order's foundation myth to the post-flood
rebuilding of civilization. The Kabeiroi initiations at Thebes and Samothrace, documented in de Grazia's *Ka*,
combined metallurgical knowledge with graded initiation rites — the same structure that would later characterize
the stonemasons' guilds.

## The Reformation: Masons Become "Freemasons"

The original Masons were *operative* builders — men who could pour geopolymer, raise Gothic cathedrals, and
engineer underground cities. Their religion was the polytheistic Christianity of the Rus-Horde Empire, in which
Christ was a historical prince and the saints were the old gods under new names. There was no "Supreme Being" in
the abstract Deist sense — there were *gods*, plural, and the builders worked under their commission.

The Reformation changed everything. As Fomenko documents, the
[Reformation was not a protest against the Catholic Church in Rome](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_19.html) —
it was a revolt against the *Greek Orthodox authority of the Rus-Horde Empire*:

> "In the late XVI century in Europe there appears a centrifugal tendency, reinforced by the deep seated
> resentment towards the Russian-Horde authorities... These feelings erupted into a major rebellion in the West.
> The epoch of the Reformation and Protestantism begins."
> — Fomenko & Nosovskiy, *How It Was In Reality*, [ch. 6.19](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_19.html)

The "Protestants" were not protesting the Pope. They were protesting the *Khan*. The entire framing of
the Reformation as a Catholic–Protestant doctrinal dispute is a post-hoc redaction that conceals the real
conflict: Western provincial governors breaking away from the Hordian Empire and seizing its territories,
treasuries, and — crucially — its *builders*.

When the empire collapsed, the Cathar-Scythian builder class was annihilated or absorbed. The new Western
states could not afford to lose the building knowledge entirely, so the guilds were permitted to survive — but
only after a thorough rebranding. The operative Masons of the Rus-Horde became the *speculative* "Freemasons" of
Protestant Europe. The transformation involved several key changes:

- **Polytheism was replaced with Monotheism.** The builders' original religion — the imperial Christianity of the
  Horde, which incorporated the old gods as saints and acknowledged multiple divine powers — was purged. In its
  place the Freemasons adopted prayer to the **GAOTU** (Great Architect of the Universe) or **TGAOTU** (The
  Great Architect of the Universe), an abstract Monotheistic creator-god acceptable to the Protestant theological
  framework. The very name "Great Architect" preserves the memory of the builders' origin while stripping it of
  any polytheistic content.

- **Building knowledge was replaced with ritual.** The original Masons knew how to *build*. The Freemasons
  performed ceremonies *about* building. The tools — compass, square, level, plumb — became symbols rather than
  instruments. The graded initiation structure survived, but the actual trade secrets (geopolymer formulas,
  underground engineering, megalithic logistics) were lost.

- **Imperial loyalty was replaced with secrecy.** The original Masons served the Khan openly. The Freemasons,
  having lost their patron, became a *secret society* — hiding not because their knowledge was dangerous, but
  because their very existence was a remnant of the empire the Reformation had destroyed.

The word "Free" in Freemason is itself ironic. The original Masons were *free* in the sense that mattered: they
traveled across the entire empire by imperial commission, building wherever the Khan directed. The "Freemasons"
were free of *nothing* — they had lost their patron, their knowledge, their religion, and their purpose. They
were less free than the original Masons in every meaningful sense.

## The Illuminati and the Building of the New Capitals

In 1776, the [Bavarian Illuminati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati) were founded by Adam Weishaupt — the
same year as the American Declaration of Independence. This was not coincidence. The Illuminati recognized that the
Freemasons, though diminished, still possessed the organizational structure, the architectural symbolism, and the
institutional memory needed to build *new* centers of power.

The Freemasons were recruited to construct three new capitals — each designed as a *replacement* for the old
Hordian centers the Reformation had destroyed:

- **Washington, D.C.** (founded 1790, laid out by Freemason architects) — the new political capital, replacing
  Moscow as the seat of empire. George Washington, a Freemason, laid the Capitol cornerstone in full Masonic
  regalia. The city's layout incorporates pentagrams, the compass-and-square, and the Washington Monument — a
  200-foot obelisk modeled on the ancient Egyptian obelisks that Fomenko identifies as Hordian constructions of
  the XIV–XVI centuries.

- **The City of London** (rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666, redesigned under heavy Masonic influence) — the
  new financial capital. The Reformation's victors had
  [moved the stolen treasury of the Empire to England](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_15.html).
  London's rebuilt center, with its Wren churches and later its obelisk (Cleopatra's Needle, moved from Egypt in
  1878), became the financial hub of the post-Hordian world.

- **Vatican City** (St. Peter's Basilica completed 1626, Vatican obelisk re-erected 1586) — the new religious
  capital. The Jesuits, who had already
  [redacted Christianity into its current form](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.02-deep-state-redacts-christianity-into-jesuit-catholicism.md),
  commissioned the construction of St. Peter's Square with its central obelisk — another Egyptian obelisk,
  originally from the same Hordian building program the Freemasons claimed to inherit.

All three capitals share the same architectural vocabulary: **obelisks** (the Hordian burial markers of the
imperial cemetery in Egypt), **domes** (modeled on Hagia Sophia = Solomon's Temple), **columns and colonnades**
(the Greco-Roman style that is itself a provincial dialect of Hordian architecture), and **spires** — tall
pointed structures that echo the polar configuration of the
[Golden Age](/content/02.the-golden-age/02.00.00-4077-bce-the-golden-age.md), when the Wheel of Heaven appeared
as a luminous column stretching from Earth to Saturn. Church steeples, cathedral spires, obelisks, and minarets
all point upward toward a *sky that no longer exists* — the Saturnian polar axis that was the original "axis
mundi." The Freemasons preserved this symbolism without understanding its origin. They built spires because the
original Masons built spires — but the original Masons built them to mirror the cosmos they had actually *seen*.

## Freemasonry in America: Rule by the Secrets-Keepers

The establishment of Freemasonry in America is documented in detail by Michael A. Hoffman II, a former reporter
for the New York Bureau of the Associated Press and author of *Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare* (2001)
and *The Occult Renaissance Church of Rome*. In a
[2019 interview](https://rielpolitik.com/2019/08/16/secret-societies-the-alchemical-processing-of-humanity-through-public-psychodrama-an-interview-with-michael-hoffman/)
(originally broadcast on [Guns and Butter](http://gunsandbutter.org)), Hoffman traces the pipeline through which
occult governance entered America — and the resistance it met once it arrived.

> **Note:** Several of Hoffman's claims below concern secret-society operations that were, by definition, never
> declassified, published, or legitimately exposed. Independent verification of such claims is inherently
> difficult: the absence of confirming records may reflect deliberate suppression rather than absence of fact. We
> include them here because the institutional patterns Hoffman describes — secret oaths, jury subornation,
> whistleblower murder, dual-party control — are corroborated by the public record where it survives.

### The Neoplatonic Pipeline: Florence → Rome → Great Britain

Hoffman argues that the standard left-right framing of the Reformation conceals a deeper continuity. The occult
gnosis that would eventually become Freemasonry entered the Catholic Church through the Florentine
Neoplatonists — Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola — in the mid-15th century:

> "Coming out of the neoplatonic, hermetic world of Florentine Italy in the middle of the 15th century, as this
> began to enter the Catholic Church ... in the hierarchy, beginning with Reverend Father Marsilio Ficino and
> Count Giovanni Pico of Mirandola, who Dame Francis Yates, one of the great historians of the occult, believes
> was probably the key guy for a three- or four-hundred-year period in studying the occult."

This infiltration coincided with the Medici papacies (Leo X, Clement VII) and the Church's abandonment of its
prohibition against usury — "if you do not forbid interest on money you will inevitably be ruled by the money
power." From Rome, the gnosis migrated to Great Britain, where it found institutional expression in Freemasonry.
Hoffman insists that the Catholic and Protestant occult traditions were not opposites but **symbiotic rivals**:

> "If you take a look at General Motors and Ford, they were both rivals and to a certain degree enemies, but they
> were both promoting the automobile in America. The same thing was true of the Western secret society ... The
> Catholic Church and the Protestant occult Church, which began to arise with Queen Elizabeth I, were rivals but
> they were promoting the same model of secret-society governance."

This aligns with our own reconstruction: the Reformation was not a doctrinal protest but a political revolt
against the Hordian Empire, and the new Protestant and Catholic power structures both inherited the same
mechanism of governance-through-secrecy, even as they competed for territory.

### "We Are the Antidote to These Terrible Religious Wars"

Hoffman describes how Freemasonry captured the American Founding:

> "Jefferson, Washington, the Adamses in New England — Freemasonry offered a completely refreshing view of the
> world in the advertising slogan that it put out, that it was above ideology, that it was above religion. And
> the men of the American Enlightenment like Jefferson, had watched in horror as Protestants and Catholics
> slaughtered each other in these wars of religion throughout the 16th and 17th centuries with an enormous loss
> of innocent life, and they swore that in the New World that would not be allowed."

Hoffman notably considers Jefferson and Washington to have been "fundamentally good" men drawn to Freemasonry by
its promise of transcending sectarian violence. Jefferson himself never formally joined the Masons. But the
institution's advertising concealed its operational reality:

> "Freemasonry gets its hold in America because it was able to grab onto the American Revolution and say, 'We are
> the antidote to these terrible religious wars.' But what they were really doing was institutionalizing this rule
> by a cryptocracy, rule by the secrets-keepers. They were undermining the courts. They were suborning jurors.
> They were part of a corrupt mass of men who used secret signs and symbolism to tell the arresting cop, when
> they were pulled over for speeding, that they were 'on the level,' as they say."

Hoffman notes that Masonic lodge language has entered everyday speech — "Are you on the square? Are you a square
dealer?" — without most speakers knowing its origin. He also connects Benjamin Franklin to the
[Hellfire Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellfire_Club) of Sir Francis Dashwood, noting that "Franklin was
actually implicated in the murder of a Masonic candidate in Philadelphia in his younger years."

### William Morgan: The First Masonic Whistleblower (1826)

The earliest documented American resistance to Freemasonry came when
[William Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_(anti-Mason)) published his exposé
*The Three Degrees of Freemasonry* in 1826, violating the solemn oath of secrecy:

> "The 9th Degree of Scottish Rite Freemasonry shows the man who violates the oath of secrecy being beheaded;
> it's dedicated to revenge, officially against the murderers of Hiram, the architect of the Temple of Solomon,
> but actually what's being conveyed is this is what happens to informants."

Morgan was kidnapped from the Canandaigua Jail in Ontario County, New York — whose sheriff was himself a Mason —
and drowned. The murder provoked a national anti-Masonic movement. Former President
[John Quincy Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams) took up the cause, becoming "probably the
most illustrious person to take up the cause of anti-Masonry in America." Hoffman also identifies anti-Masonic
sentiment in Lincoln's cabinet during the Civil War, while the Confederacy was "far more Masonic" — its most
powerful Freemason being [Albert Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pike), Grand Commander of the
Southern Rite of Scottish Freemasonry.

### The KKK as a Masonic Organization

Hoffman, citing both his mentor James Shelby Downard and the Nation of Islam's two-volume
*The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews*, identifies the
[Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) as a Masonic organization:

> "The Ku Klux Klan was Masonic ... It was a Masonic organization, so a lot of the depredations against black
> people in the South were Masonic, yet Freemasonry advertises itself as being the opposite of that, an
> enlightened organization."

This is consistent with the reconstructed timeline: the Klan's "Invisible Empire" was a Masonic governance
structure transplanted onto the post-Civil War South, using the same oaths, degrees, and rituals.

### "On the Eclipse": Freemasonry After Accomplishing Its Objectives

Hoffman observes that Freemasonry is now in decline — not because it failed, but because it succeeded:

> "It's largely on the eclipse now. It used to be the master Mason in your local town was a top lawyer or a
> top surgeon, physician, some illustrious person like that. Now it could be a member of the working class,
> because they've accomplished most of the objectives that were set out for them, and therefore they are no
> longer needed."

The final proof of the cryptocracy's reach, per Hoffman, is bipartisan: in the 2004 presidential election, both
Senator [John Kerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry) and President
[George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush) were members of the
[Skull & Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones) secret society at Yale University. Bush told Tim
Russert on national television that he could not discuss his membership: "I can't do it. It's too secret."

> "So whether we chose Kerry or whether we chose Bush we were getting a secret society initiate ... They're
> openly admitting their thralldom to this cryptocracy. It's quite a thing in America."

## What the Freemasons Actually Built (and What They Claimed)

The great irony of Freemasonry is that the organization claims descent from the builders of Solomon's Temple,
the Pyramids, and the Gothic cathedrals — structures they had *nothing to do with*. The original Masons, the
Cathar-Scythian master-builders of the Rus-Horde, constructed:

- The **Gothic cathedrals** of Western Europe (XIV–XVI cc.)
- The **Kremlins** and fortified cities of Russia
- The **Great Pyramids** and temples of Egypt (as Hordian imperial funerary monuments)
- The **pyramids of Central America** (built by Cossack-Horde colonists)
- **Baalbek** and the megalithic constructions of the Middle East
- **Hagia Sophia** = Solomon's Temple
- The **Great Wall** of China
- The **underground cities** of Moscow, Cappadocia, and Derinkuyu

The Freemasons, by contrast, built:

- **Government buildings** in Washington, London, and elsewhere — competent but unremarkable neoclassical
  structures that imitate Greco-Roman (i.e., Hordian provincial) style without the megalithic ambition
- **Masonic lodges and temples** — the lodges themselves, decorative but structurally modest
- **Monuments and memorials** — obelisks, statues, and commemorative arches, mostly in the 18th–19th centuries

Nothing the Freemasons built compares in scale, precision, or ambition to the works of the original Masons.
The Colosseum in Rome — which Fomenko identifies as an
[18th-century replica](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_21.html) of a genuinely old XIV–XV century
Czar-Grad structure — is more impressive than anything the Freemasons ever constructed. The Freemasons inherited
the *name*, the *symbols*, and the *organizational structure* of the imperial builders, but not their
knowledge, not their materials science, and not their imperial patron.

The Freemasons are to the original Masons what a Civil War reenactor is to a soldier: they wear the uniform,
they know the drill, but they have never fought the battle.

## The Regius Poem Reconsidered

The Freemasons' oldest document, the Regius Poem of ~1390, describes a guild with strict hierarchy, Christian
obligations, oaths of secrecy, geometric knowledge, and loyalty to a distant sovereign. Every one of these
features maps onto the Hordian master-builder class. The poem was already a *copy* — meaning the tradition it
describes predates 1390 by at least a generation, placing its origin squarely in the 13th–14th century founding
period of the Rus-Horde Empire.

The Masons do not know their own origin because the empire that created them was *erased from history* by the
Reformation. The "Middle Ages stonemasons' guilds" from which Freemasonry arose were not local European
tradesmen's associations — they were the provincial outposts of an imperial building program that spanned from
China to Mexico, directed from the center of the Rus-Horde Empire, and founded on the commission of a crucified
prince who declared he would rebuild the temple.

The Freemasons who came after them preserved the name, the symbols, the hierarchy, and the secrecy — but traded
away everything that mattered. They traded polytheism for Monotheism, calling their god the "Great Architect" as
if architecture were a metaphor rather than their literal vocation. They traded building knowledge for ritual
performance. They traded imperial freedom for secret society paranoia. And when the Illuminati came calling, they
traded their independence for the privilege of constructing Washington, London, and the Vatican — competent
imitations of the Hordian originals, built with inferior knowledge, for masters who understood even less.
