# Historical Christ dies

According to [Japanese legend](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-little-known-legend-of-jesus-in-japan-165354242/),
Christ survived his crucifixion, travelled east to Japan, and
[died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing%C5%8D,_Aomori#%22Tomb_of_Jesus%22)
at *Kirisuto no haka* at the age of 106. See [Alleged Resurrection](/content/06.ce-12th-birth-of-christianity/06.05.01-alleged-resurrection.md)
for the full account including the sign text at the tomb and the alternate history of Christ's brother Isukiri.

## The Legend of Shingo

The village of [Shingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing%C5%8D,_Aomori) in Aomori Prefecture, Japan, claims to be
the final resting place of Jesus Christ. According to the local tradition — preserved in the *Takenouchi Documents* — Christ
first arrived in Japan at the age of 21 to study theology under a great master near Mount Fuji. He returned to Judea
at 33, was arrested, but escaped crucifixion by substituting his brother Isukiri on the cross. Christ then fled east
across Siberia and Alaska, eventually reaching the northern coast of Japan. He settled in what is now Shingo, married a
Japanese woman named Miyuko, fathered three daughters, and lived as a rice farmer under the name **Daitenku Taro Jurai**.

A sign at the twin burial mounds (*Kirisuto no haka*) reads:

> *"When Jesus Christ was 21 years old, he came to Japan and pursued knowledge of divinity for 12 years. He went back
> to Judea at age 33, and after his crucifixion, his brother Isukiri took his place and Jesus who escaped from the
> execution traversed the land of Siberia to Alaska, and came to the Aomori Place, where he died at the age of 106."*

The village holds an annual *Christ Festival* (Kirisuto Matsuri) every June, where participants dance around the burial
mounds in traditional costume. Whether this is genuine transmission or later fabrication, the tradition is notable for
preserving the same core claim as the Fomenko chronology: that Christ survived the crucifixion and lived to old age.

In the New Chronology, Christ's birth in 1152 CE + 106 years = death in **1258 CE**, placing his passing within the
period of the Rus-Horde Empire's consolidation — the very empire his teachings had set in motion.

*According to Japanese tradition, Christ survived the crucifixion, travelled east to Japan, and died peacefully at Kirisuto no haka at the age of 106.*
