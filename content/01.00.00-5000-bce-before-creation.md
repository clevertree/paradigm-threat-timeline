# Before Creation

![Before Creation](/media/01.before-creation/before-creation.png)

Ancient testimony from different civilizations seem to agree that there was no *history* (or time) before the
"creation" event. In all accounts, the time before the Golden Age was a lasting darkness. During this dark period,
Saturn's dwarf system was beginning to receive its first energy from the Sun, and with this energy came the first life
forms capable of having memory. As Saturn had not yet joined the Sun's orbit, there was no way to account for time.

## Saturn as a Brown Dwarf Star

According to Jno Cook's *Recovering the Lost World* ([Chapter 2: A Synopsis](https://saturniancosmology.org/syn.php)),
Earth was not always a planet of our Sun. From its genesis, Earth was a satellite of Saturn — then a **sub-brown dwarf
star** wandering through space. Saturn generated its own faint infrared light and plasma output, sustaining the
Saturnian System in deep space, far from any solar influence. Earth was contained Saturn in this remote, dark sub-system. The Gas planets Venus, Neptune, Uranus, and Jupiter were not yet formed. Neither were Mercury or Mars. All planets would reach their final form in the 'Big Bang' caused by the electronic bond forming between our Sun and the Brown Dwarf Saturn.

## The Long Darkness: A Universal Memory

Cross-cultural mythology from every continent converges on one memory: before "creation," the sky was formless,
dark, and chaotic for an immense period of time. As Cook writes in
[Chapter 13: The Creation](https://saturniancosmology.org/polar.php):

> *"It was universally held that the past before 'creation' was a long period during which the skies were in chaos
> and featureless turmoil."*

This matches sources from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, India, Scandinavia, and indigenous traditions worldwide.
The myths do not describe metaphorical voids — they describe a real observational condition: Earth was enveloped
inside Saturn's **plasma coma** in **glow mode**, which obscured all stars and the Sun. From the surface of Earth,
there was nothing to see but swirling luminous mist above — no stars, no sun, no regular sky.

Dwardu Cardona's *God Star* (2006) traces these "chaos" descriptions across diverse mythological traditions, noting
that the primordial condition was typically described as a hovering cloud or ocean of mist, often with a twisted column
of vapor reaching from the sky down to the Earth — consistent with a plasma discharge in glow mode connecting Saturn
to Earth's surface.

## The Egg of Creation: ~4900 BC

Around **4900 BC**, after thousands of years of featureless sky, a circular shape became dimly visible through the
swirling clouds above the North Pole — a globe ten to twenty times the apparent diameter of the Moon. This was Saturn,
its glow-mode coma beginning to thin. The globe appeared white and inactive, rotating slowly around the polar axis
once per day. This is the origin of the **Cosmic Egg** motif found globally:

- The Egyptian creator God Ra emerging from the lotus or the primeval egg
- The Vedic creator Brahma, whose sacred animal is the *goose* (observed as the planet Uranus displaced from the
  central axis, appearing like a duck's head with a neck connected to the globe of Saturn)
- Orphic and Phoenician creation eggs
- Greek *Ouranus* ("Father Sky") as the original globe overhead

The Egyptian hieroglyph for Ra is a duck. Egg-shaped designs appear on pottery in Eastern Europe from approximately
5000 BC onward, precisely when Cook dates the Egg's first visibility.

## Why There Was No Time Before Creation

The insight that there was "no history before creation" is not merely philosophical. Without a visible Sun, there
could be no solar calendar — no days, no seasons, no years in any recognizable modern sense. The only motion
observable was Saturn's daily rotation about the north polar axis, and whatever periodic changes the plasma column
made over long intervals.

Cook notes in [Chapter 14: The Start of Time](https://saturniancosmology.org/time.php) that when Saturn **nova'd**
in **4077 BC** — transitioning from glow mode to arc mode and blazing suddenly like a sun — the skies of Earth
cleared for the first time. The Sun became visible. The concept of *regular solar time* began. All civilization
founding myths, king lists, and calendrical "year one" dates cluster at or after this event. This is "Creation."

## Key Dates (Saturnian Cosmology Model)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Before 10,900 BC | Earth orbits Saturn in deep space; Saturn in glow mode; faint infrared light only |
| ~10,900 BC | Earth enters Saturn's coma; full obscuration begins; |
| ~8347 BC | Earth settles into sub-polar orbit below Saturn; Hypsithermal warm period begins |
| ~4900 BC | Saturn (the "Cosmic Egg") becomes faintly visible through thinning plasma cloud |
| **4077 BC** | **Saturn nova event — "Creation" — arc mode ignition, skies clear, Age of the Gods begins** |
