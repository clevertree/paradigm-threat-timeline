The religious schism in Europe continued to grow into the 15th century with no clear solutions available.
Once again, this allowed the Deep State to exploit the situation laying the foundations for the *next war*.
They just needed to find a *good reason* to trigger it.

By the middle of the 15th century, the popularity of
Dionysian [orgies](https://vermiliongoldfishartblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/pompeii-pornography-power/) had led to the
widespread proliferation of transmissible disease. Knowledge of disease and medicine was still limited, and
superstitious populations would regard the spread of illness with suspicion, often exiling the sick. The Empire had a
serious problem and didn't know how to solve it. It was once again time for the **Deep State** to step in and take
advantage. The fear of wide-spread disease could be exploited to bring Europe into a new Crusade. They had the
*reason* to go to war-now they needed the *means*.

*“There were several brothels located in Pompeii — appearing to be part of the Roman culture — that were vastly decorated with pictures representing different sexual similes above the entryways to the cubicles. A fresco from one such brothel depicts a man and woman making love on a bed. The woman is sitting on top of the man with what appears to be a breast band around her chest. Her right arm is outstretched with her hand resting on the bed to the left of his head.” [Source](https://vermiliongoldfishartblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/pompeii-pornography-power/)*
