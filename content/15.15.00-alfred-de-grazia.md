## Primary Contribution

"Quantavolution" — the theoretical framework for rapid, catastrophic change as the driver of geological and human history. De Grazia coined the term *quantavolution* to describe sudden, quantum-leap changes in Earth's geology, biology, and human society driven by cosmic catastrophe — as opposed to uniformitarian gradual change.

He was a close associate of Velikovsky, the principal systematizer of the catastrophist intellectual project, and the author of the most comprehensive single body of catastrophist literature (15 volumes).

## The Quantavolution Series

De Grazia produced a 15-volume series *Quantavolution & Catastrophe* covering cosmology, Earth science, myth, psychology, language, and history from a unified catastrophist perspective. Key volumes:

- **Chaos and Creation** (1981) — young Earth/solar system thesis
- **Solaria Binaria** (1984, with Earl Milton) — Saturn as the binary star that was Earth's original sun
- **Homo Schizo I & II** (1983) — human psychological nature as a product of catastrophic trauma
- **Lately Tortured Earth** (1983) — geological evidence for recent catastrophism
- **The Disastrous Love Affair of Moon and Mars** (1984) — Moon–Mars close encounter mythology
- **The Burning of Troy** (1984) — Bronze Age collapse as electromagnetic catastrophe
- **God's Fire** (1983) — Moses and the Exodus as plasma/electrical catastrophe
- **The Divine Succession** (1983) — the sequence of planetary gods as real orbital history
- **The Iron Age of Mars** (2009) — final synthesis incorporating Talbott, Thornhill, Cardona
