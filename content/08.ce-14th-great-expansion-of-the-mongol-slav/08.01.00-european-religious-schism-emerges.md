# European Religious Schism Emerges

![European Religious Schism Emerges](/media/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/14th-religious-schism.png)

Within the Great Empire of the 14th century, a profound religious fault-line ran between two forms of Christianity:
**Royal (Hereditary) Christianity** — the older dynastic faith of the czar-khans — and the emerging **Apostles'
Christianity**, a reformed popular faith that culminated in the [Battle of Kulikovo (~1370–1380)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kulikovo).
Fomenko and Nosovskiy identify this conflict as the same event recorded in Roman sources as Constantine the Great's
victory over Maxentius, and in the Old Testament as David and Goliath. **Dmitry Donskoi = Constantine I** baptised
the entire Horde Empire into Apostles' Christianity by the end of the 14th century.

## The Deep State Exploits the Schism

The Deep State learned during the Crusade that it could exploit religious divisions to trigger wars — and now set about engineering the *next one*. Operating behind the scenes in the new Kremlin capital, it simultaneously **controlled the opposition** in the western provinces, giving orders to scattered priesthoods to resist the Empire and quietly preserve Monotheism. In defiance of Christianity, Western Europe continued to [practice in secret](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sephardim#3) the Monotheistic religion of the Deep State. In public, they engaged in unlawful [Dionysian orgy ceremonies](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html). The Rus-Horde officials were dumbfounded by this *heretical* behaviour. They watched western *pagans* commit sacrifice rituals and attempt to communicate with and take orders from [invisible spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn). Over the next two centuries the local populations would start publicly [burning heretics at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_burned_as_heretics), eventually leading the Rus-Horde to begin an [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) in search of a peaceful solution.

## Two Branches of Government

The schism had a structural dimension. Ivan Kalita (= Batu Khan) had, upon founding the Vatican, left behind
**two branches of government** — the czarist branch in Russia and the papal branch in Italy. These two branches
fought for supremacy long after his death. Western Europe's resistance to the Horde was therefore both religious
*and* political: newly minted "ancient" histories would be composed in the 17th–18th centuries to erase all memory
of the Russian presence, including the deliberate suppression of Slavonic readings of Etruscan inscriptions
and the relocation of "Novgorod" from Yaroslavl-on-Volga to an obscure swampy site on the Volkhov River.

The existence of two branches was itself a vulnerability. By placing agents in *both* the Kremlin and the Vatican, the Deep State could play one against the other — a strategy that would reach its climax with the [Heresy of the Judaizers](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_01.html) in the XVI century, when the Protestant infiltrators would use the Vatican branch to authorise a full revolt against the Horde.

## The Seeds of 1492

The Deep State was not improvising. It was planning centuries ahead. During the 14th century — while the Horde expanded confidently and the [Masons](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.01-the-masons.md) raised cathedrals from Florence to Giza — the Deep State was quietly preparing for the events of the [15th century](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.00.00-1400-ce-15th-century-ottoman-conquest-of-europe.md): the "discovery" of America (in reality, the Hordian colonial routes rebranded), the [Gutenberg Bible](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.03.01-1455-ce-bible-translated-into-latin.md) (the printing press weaponised to rewrite history into Latin), and the Treaty of Tordesillas (the division of the world between "Spain" = Russia-Horde and "Portugal" = Ottoman Empire). All of these required decades of preparation. The rot that would eventually [split the Empire](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.00.00-1500-ce-16th-century-reformation-inquisition.md) was being cultivated now, in the shadow of the Horde's greatest century.

*In this illustrated [manuscript](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361166387_Plague_and_Popular_Revival_Ecclesiastical_Authorities_and_the_Bianchi_Devotions_in_1399/fulltext/63639dc5431b1f5300688acd/Plague-and-Popular-Revival-Ecclesiastical-Authorities-and-the-Bianchi-Devotions-in-1399.pdf) painted in Tuscany at the end of the 14th Century, devils shoot down arrows to inflict horror upon a tangled mass of humanity. Religious processions were commonly held during plague outbreaks in medieval Europe to provide succour against disease. During the Black Death of 1347–52, for example, a flagellant revival occurred, although this was condemned by church authorities as it descended into anti-clerical violence. Whether the Black Death itself was a natural event or a weapon deployed against the Horde's population base remains an open question.*
