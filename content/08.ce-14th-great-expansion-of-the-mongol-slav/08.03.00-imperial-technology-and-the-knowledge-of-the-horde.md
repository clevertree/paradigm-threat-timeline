# Imperial Technology and the Knowledge of the Horde

The Great Expansion of the 14th century was a technological conquest as much as a military one. The Horde's ability to build monuments that still stand, forge metals that modern metallurgists struggle to replicate, and project force across three continents rested on a unified knowledge base that Scaligerian history has fragmented into dozens of supposedly independent "civilizations." Fomenko's reconstruction restores the picture: one Empire, one knowledge tradition, deliberately shattered by later chroniclers into "Greek," "Arabic," "Egyptian," "Indian," and "Chinese" strands.

## Geopolymer Concrete and the Philosopher's Stone

The monumental construction of this era — the Egyptian pyramids, Hagia Sophia, Baalbek, the Great Wall — shares a common secret: **geopolymer concrete**. Fomenko identifies this as the historical reality behind the **Philosopher's Stone** ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html)). It was not a mystical object — it was a chemical binder that, added to crushed stone debris and water, produced artificial stone indistinguishable from natural rock. The Horde could cast enormous blocks in situ (eliminating the impossible quarrying and transport of 1,000+ ton monoliths at Baalbek), reproduce any desired shape, and work at enormous scale and speed.

The "alchemical" tradition of medieval Europe — the obsessive coded search for a transformative substance — is the garbled memory of this lost technology. When the Empire fractured in the 17th century and the formula was lost, later scholars could only interpret the surviving texts as mysticism.

## Cannon Technology — The Cross and the Cannon

Fomenko connects the cannon directly to the **Cross** ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §27](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html)): the Russian word for cannon (*pushka*) and the cross-shaped gun carriage are linked. Imperial banners carried the cross as a **symbol of their decisive weapon**. Combined with [Damask steel](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.02.00-1453-ce-hundred-years-war-ends-fall-of-czar-grad.md), cannon artillery made the Horde unstoppable by the early 15th century.

## The "Arabic Golden Age" — A Single Knowledge Base

There was no separate "Arab" civilization parallel to the Horde — the Arabic-speaking scholars were part of the same Empire. Arabic inscriptions appear on Russian imperial weapons of the 14th–16th centuries. Horde coins bear both Slavonic and Arabic. "Damascus steel" derives from Mosokh = Moscow, not the Syrian city. The "Greek → Arabic → Latin" translation chain was not a chain of civilizations but of *administrative languages* within one Empire.

The "Islamic Golden Age" dissolves into what it was: the **scientific wing of the Horde**, staffed by scholars writing in Arabic (one of the Empire's co-languages alongside Slavonic, Turkic, and Greek). When the Empire split, each successor state claimed "its own" ancient tradition — Arabs took the Arabic texts, Greeks the Greek ones, Latins the translations.

## Roman Numerals — Carpenter Marks

Fomenko demonstrates that Roman numerals originated as **Russian carpenter and builder marks** ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §20](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html)) — a practical tally notation for marking timber and stone. These marks spread across Europe during the Great Expansion and were later attributed to a fictional "Ancient Rome."

## Alchemy and Metallurgy

Medieval alchemy was the **degraded residue of Horde industrial metallurgy**: tin, copper, and bronze production on industrial scale; iron smelting for cannon and armour; the "transmutation of metals" encoding real processes like cupellation (extracting gold from lead ore). When the Empire fragmented, its metallurgical techniques became orphaned trade secrets, surviving only as cryptic manuscripts later generations read as mysticism.

## The Astronomical Foundation

Fomenko's statistical analysis of Ptolemy's *Almagest* demonstrates its star catalogue dates to the **medieval period** (~600–1300 CE), not the 2nd century AD ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §37](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_34.html)). The astronomical knowledge was collected by Horde-era observers — essential for navigation and fleet movements. The backdating by ~1,200 years was part of the same programme that created the fictional "Ancient World."
