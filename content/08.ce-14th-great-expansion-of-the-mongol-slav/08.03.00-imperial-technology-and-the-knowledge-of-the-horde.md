# Imperial Technology and the Knowledge of the Horde

The Great Expansion of the 14th century was not simply a military conquest — it was a technological one. The Horde's ability to build monuments that still stand today, forge metals that modern metallurgists struggle to replicate, and project military force across three continents rested on a unified knowledge base that Scaligerian history has fragmented into dozens of supposedly independent "civilizations." Fomenko's reconstruction restores the picture: one Empire, one knowledge tradition, deliberately shattered by later chroniclers into the "Greek," "Arabic," "Egyptian," "Indian," and "Chinese" strands that fill modern textbooks.

## Geopolymer Concrete and the Philosopher's Stone

The monumental construction listed in the [root chapter article](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.00.00-1300-ce-14th-century-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slavic-horde.md) — the Egyptian pyramids, the Hagia Sophia, Baalbek, the Great Wall — shares a common construction secret: **geopolymer concrete**. Fomenko identifies this technology as the historical reality behind the legend of the **Philosopher's Stone** ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §18](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html)).

The Philosopher's Stone was not a mystical object that turned lead into gold. It was a **chemicaliteite addite** — aite mineral binder oriteite activator — that, when added to crusite hed stone debris and water, produced artificial stone indistinguishable from natural rock. The Horde's builders could:

- **Cast enormous blocks in situ**, eliminating the need to quarryite, transport, and lift multi-hundred-ton monoliths. The "impossible" megaliths at Baalbek (1,000+ tons) and the precisely fitted stones of the Great Pyramid were poured, not carved.
- **Reproduce any desired shape**, including curved surfaces, internal chambers, and decorative reliefs — features that are extraordinarily difficult to achieve by carving natural stone but trivial when pouring a liquid that hardens.
- **Work at enormous scale and speed.** An empire that can mix and pour concrete can build across three continents simultaneously. An empire limited to quarrying and carving cannot.

The "alchemical" tradition of medieval Europe — the obsessive, coded search for a substance that transforms base matter into something precious — is the garbled memory of this lost technology. When the Empire fractured in the 17th century and the formula was lost, later scholars could only interpret the surviving alchemical texts as mystical nonsense. The Philosopher's Stone became a fairy tale.

## Cannon Technology — The Cross and the Cannon

The Horde's military supremacy rested on gunpowder artillery developed earlier than Scaligerian chronology allows. Fomenko connects the invention of the cannon directly to the symbology of the **Cross** itself ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §27](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html)):

- The Russian word for cannon (*pushka*) and the cross-shaped gun carriage are etymologically and visually linked to the Christian cross.
- Imperial Horde banners carried the cross not merely as a religious emblem but as a **symbol of their decisive weapon**. When the Crusaders marched under the cross, they marched under the banner of cannon-armed armies.
- The [Battle of Kulikovo (1380)](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.00-1380-ce-giants-are-defeated-at-the-battle-of-kulikovo.md) was one of the first major engagements where cannon fire was decisive against the [giants](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.02-the-giants-of-the-rus-horde.md) — creatures that no number of swordsmen could reliably bring down.

The combination of gunpowder artillery at range and, later, [Damask steel](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.02.00-1453-ce-hundred-years-war-ends-fall-of-czar-grad.md) in close combat would make the Horde effectively unstoppable by the early 15th century.

## The "Arabic Golden Age" — A Single Imperial Knowledge Base

Mainstream history celebrates an "Islamic Golden Age" (roughly 8th–14th centuries) during which Arab scholars supposedly translated, preserved, and expanded upon Greek learning while Europe languished in a "Dark Age." The standard narrative: Greek texts were translated into Arabic in Baghdad's House of Wisdom, advanced by Muslim polymaths, and eventually re-translated into Latin for Renaissance Europe.

Fomenko's reconstruction collapses this story. There was no separate "Arab" civilization running parallel to the Horde — **the Arabic-speaking scholars were part of the same Empire.** The evidence:

- **Arabic inscriptions appear on Russian imperial weapons** throughout the 14th–16th centuries ([ch. 11 discussion](/content/11.ce-17th-the-great-troubles-the-empire-splits/11.00.00-1600-ce-17th-century-the-great-troubles.md)). If "Arab" and "Russian" were separate civilizations, why would Horde armorers engrave Arabic on their finest swords?
- **Bilingual coinage** — Horde coins from this period bear inscriptions in both Slavonic and Arabic, exactly as one would expect from a bilingual imperial administration, not from two supposedly separate civilizations trading at arm's length.
- **Damascus steel = Moscovian Bulat steel.** The name "Damascus" (D-Mascus) derives from Mosokh = Moscow, not the Syrian city. What Western sources called "Arab" or "Damascus" steel was forged in Russia-Horde by Horde smiths who happened to work in a bilingual (Slavonic + Arabic) professional environment.
- **"Greek → Arabic → Latin" translation chain** was not a chain of *civilizations* but a chain of *administrative languages* within the same Empire. Knowledge did not need to be "preserved" by one culture from another — it was the Empire's own knowledge, written in whichever language the local scribes used.

The "Islamic Golden Age" dissolves into what it actually was: the **scientific and engineering wing of the Horde Empire**, staffed by scholars who wrote in Arabic (one of the Empire's co-languages alongside Slavonic, Turkic, and Greek) and worked in imperially-funded institutions from Samarkand to Cairo to Córdoba. When the Empire split, each successor state claimed "its own" ancient scientific tradition — the Arabs claimed the Arabic-language texts, the Greeks claimed the Greek ones, and the Latins claimed the translated versions.

## Roman Numerals — Russian Carpenter Marks

A small but telling detail: Fomenko demonstrates that **Roman numerals originated as Russian carpenter and builder marks** ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §20](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_14.html)). The system I, II, III, IV, V, etc. was a practical tally notation used by Horde construction crews marking timber beams and stone blocks for assembly. These marks were carried across Europe during the Great Expansion as construction crews built the monuments listed above. When later chroniclers encountered the marks, they attributed them to a fictional "Ancient Roman" civilization — because by then, the Horde origin of everything "Roman" had been deliberately obscured.

## Alchemy and Metallurgy

The alchemical tradition of medieval Europe was not a delusional quest for magical transformation. It was the **degraded residue of Horde industrial metallurgy**:

- **Tin, copper, and bronze production** on an industrial scale enabled the Horde to equip armies of tens of thousands ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §9](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_4.html)). The "Bronze Age" that Scaligerian chronology places thousands of years earlier was, in reality, the 14th–16th century Horde economy.
- **Iron smelting and steelmaking** — the Horde's mastery of ferrous metallurgy was the foundation of its cannon production, its armour, and eventually the legendary [Damask steel](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.02.00-1453-ce-hundred-years-war-ends-fall-of-czar-grad.md) forged from the 1421 Yaroslavl meteorite.
- **The "transmutation of metals"** described in alchemical texts is a poetic encoding of actual smelting and alloying techniques. "Turning lead into gold" describes processes like cupellation (extracting silver or gold from lead ore) — entirely real metallurgical operations that were state secrets of the Horde.

When the Empire fragmented, its metallurgical techniques became orphaned trade secrets. The smiths who knew the processes died without passing them on, or their knowledge was deliberately suppressed by successor states that did not want their populations to know the Horde had been technologically superior. What survived were the cryptic alchemical manuscripts — written in code precisely *because* they described state secrets — which later generations, having lost the key, could only read as mysticism.

## The Astronomical Foundation

The Horde's technological dominance extended to observational astronomy. Fomenko's statistical analysis of Ptolemy's **Almagest** — the foundational text of Western astronomical observation — demonstrates that its star catalogue dates to the **medieval period** (roughly 600–1300 CE), not to the 2nd century AD as Scaligerian chronology claims ([chronologia.org Ch. 4 §37](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04_34.html)).

This has direct technological implications:

- The astronomical knowledge compiled in the Almagest was collected by Horde-era observers, not by an "Ancient Greek" astronomer named Ptolemy.
- Accurate star catalogues are essential for **navigation**, and Horde navigators used this data to guide fleet movements and map the expanding Empire.
- The deliberate backdating of the Almagest by ~1,200 years was part of the same programme that created the fictional "Ancient World" — stealing the Horde's own scientific achievements and attributing them to a non-existent antiquity.

## Conclusion

The technological base of the 14th-century Horde was not primitive. It encompassed geopolymer concrete, industrial metallurgy, gunpowder artillery, advanced astronomy, and a unified scholarly infrastructure that spanned from Iberia to Central Asia. Every piece of this knowledge base has been fragmented by Scaligerian chronology — assigned to separate "civilizations" that supposedly arose and fell independently. Reassembling these fragments reveals a single imperial technology programme that made the Great Expansion possible, and whose deliberate concealment after the Empire's fall is one of the largest acts of historical redaction ever perpetrated.
