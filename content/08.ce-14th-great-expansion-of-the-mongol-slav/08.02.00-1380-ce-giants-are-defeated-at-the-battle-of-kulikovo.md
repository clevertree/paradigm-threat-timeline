# Giants are defeated at the Battle of Kulikovo

The [Battle of Kulikovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kulikovo) (~1380 CE) was the decisive turning-point of the 14th century — and perhaps of all recorded history. The [giants of the Horde](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.02-the-giants-of-the-rus-horde.md), who had led the Empire's armies since its founding, were defeated by the new "Marathon" cannon technology of the smaller humans. **Royal (Hereditary) Christianity** fell; **Apostles' Christianity** — the reformed popular faith — triumphed. The giants lost all authority over the Rus-Horde Empire and became permanent enemies of the state: enslaved, hunted, and eradicated.

*The Battle of Kulikovo marks the moment cannon technology overcame armored giants — remembered as the story of David vs Goliath and the Battle of Marathon.*

## The Weapon That Changed Everything

Metal cannons — deployed en masse for the first time — could penetrate the heavy armour that had made giants virtually invincible on the battlefield. When the giants realised the smaller humans possessed an undefeatable weapon, they surrendered. The theological and political significance was immediate: after Kulikovo, **Dmitry Donskoi = Constantine the Great** baptised the entire Empire into Apostles' Christianity and established **hereditary succession** of the czarist throne — replacing the older system in which giant clan-leaders had rotated power among themselves.

## Thirty Phantom Reflections

Fomenko identifies the Battle of Kulikovo as the single most duplicated event in world history, reflected across **at least 30 phantom copies** scattered through Classical, Biblical, and medieval chronicles. Among the most telling:

- **David and Goliath** (1 Samuel 17) — A young king defeats a *giant* warrior with a "sling" (= cannon). Judaism and Christianity both enshrined this moment as their founding myth of courage against a larger foe.
- **The Gallic War giant** — Roman histories record a monstrous Gallic champion slain by a smaller Roman soldier; the "barbarian" army collapses immediately after.
- **King Arthur and the giant** — Geoffrey of Monmouth has Arthur personally fight "a fierce giant" at Mont-Saint-Michel, then conquer the continent.
- **Zeus and the Titans** — The Greek gods overthrow the race of Titans with the help of the "mighty [Cyclops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclops)" — which Fomenko notes is a transparent metaphor for *cannons*: a single "eye" (= muzzle) that hurls thunderbolts (= cannonballs). The entire Titanomachy is the Battle of Kulikovo viewed through the Greek mythological lens.
- **The Battle of Marathon** (490 BCE) — "Javelins" defeat a vastly larger army. The Greek city-states (= smaller humans) prevail against the Persian Empire (= the Horde). The chronological distance (~1870 years) is a classic Fomenko shift.
- **Constantine defeats Maxentius** — Fomenko's primary identification: Dmitry Donskoi *is* Constantine I, and the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity *is* the conversion of the Horde after Kulikovo.

Each of these narratives preserves a common skeleton: a younger, smaller champion overcomes a race of giants (or a single giant champion) with a new weapon or divine intervention. The sheer number of duplicates testifies to the event's traumatic importance — it had to be re-narrated in every literary tradition the Empire controlled.

## The Giant Rises Against Church and State

*An [extraordinary document](https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/wade-extraordinary-black-book-an-exposition-of-abuses-in-church-and-state-1832) detailing the corruption and financial abuses of the British government — sinecures and privileges of the army, church, and other groups. Drawn up by John Wade (1832) as part of the radical movement to expand the franchise in England.*

Wade's *Extraordinary Black Book* was published in **1832** — over 400 years after Kulikovo — yet its frontispiece depicts a **giant rising to break the chains** of church and state. The image is startling in context: in mainstream chronology, giants are safely mythological by the 19th century. But if the memory of the Horde's giant-led military class was still alive in radical political circles, then the *Black Book*'s imagery is not metaphor — it is a call to remember what was lost. The giant in Wade's engraving is the *Horde itself*, enslaved by the very institutions (church and monarchy) that seized power after Kulikovo.

The defeat of the giants did not end the chapter — it set the stage for two centuries of struggle.
