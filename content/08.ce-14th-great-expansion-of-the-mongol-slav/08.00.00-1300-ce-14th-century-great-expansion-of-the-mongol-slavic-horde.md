# 14th Century C.E.: The Great Expansion — Triumph and Betrayal

The 14th century is the story of two empires inhabiting the same body. On the outside, the Rus-Horde reached the zenith of its power — a military, architectural, and cultural expansion without parallel in recorded history. On the inside, the [court was already being infiltrated](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.00-a-second-golden-age.md) by the very forces the Crusade had sought to destroy. By the century's end, the cracks would erupt in civil war at the [Battle of Kulikovo](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.03.00-1380-ce-giants-are-defeated-at-the-battle-of-kulikovo.md).

## The External Triumph

By the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, a final unification of the diverse peoples of Russia was
completed under **Georgiy Danilovich** (Grand Prince of Moscow), whom western and eastern sources record as **Genghis Khan**.
He united Vladimir and Suzdal Rus' under the rule of *Lord Novgorod the Great* — the chronicles' name for the capital
region centred on Yaroslavl. His brother **Ivan Danilovich Kalita** (recorded in western sources as both *Batu Khan* and
*Pope Innocent III*) continued the expansion and, according to Fomenko and Nosovskiy, **founded the Vatican and Rome in
Italy** as a western centre of social and religious power — the word *VATI-KAN* being a Latinised rendering of *Batu Khan*.

By the middle of the 14th century the Russian cavalry began their invasion of Europe, Africa and India, in a
wide-reaching offensive. As a result a considerable part of Eurasia was colonized. In the Western European sources
the Rus-Horde is reflected as the **Habsburg Empire of the XIV–XVI cc.** — *Habsburg* itself possibly deriving from
the Slavonic *HAB* (= NEW) + *BURG* (= CITY), i.e. **Novgorod = New City**. Scaligerian Chronology elsewhere remembers
Rus-Horde as the **Etruscans** who founded Rome: 19th-century scholars Chertkov and Volansky demonstrated that Etruscan
inscriptions are readable as Slavonic, and the Etruscans called themselves *Rasenna* — the Rasens, the Russians.
The Horde chose **Florence** as the Italian capital; the Imperial headquarters was established separately, forming what
later became Rome.

With the expansion of the Empire came monumental construction across the known world, all dated by Fomenko to the
same 14th–16th century window:
- Magnificent [Tartarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-27/inside-architecture-s-wildest-conspiracy-theory) style cathedrals and chambers across Western Europe and North America
- The **Great Wall of China**
- The massive **Hagia Sophia** in Istanbul (identified as the Temple of Solomon / Jerusalem = Czar-Grad)
- The **Great Sphinx** and **Egyptian Pyramids** at Giza — built in geopolymer concrete by Cossack-Hordian Mamelukes
- The megalithic platform at **Baalbek** (Lebanon)
- Great pyramids and temples of Central America

In Egypt, a central imperial cemetery was established near the Giza plateau to inter the mummified Czar-Khans.
The dry sand [preserved](http://www.historyshistories.com/egypt-burial-practices.html) the bodies transported
by large oared boats (*strugi*) across the Mediterranean — the "River Styx" of Egyptian mythology. The *30 dynasties
of Egyptian pharaohs* are, in this reconstruction, phantom reflections of the dynasty of Russian czar-khans of the
13th–16th centuries. The famous **Hyksos** invasion of Egypt corresponds to the Mongol-Hordian conquest of the 14th century.

## The Hundred Years War Begins

As a result of the 14th-century Mongol-Hordian conquest, many vassal states formed across the planet. Some states
were created by peaceful means and rewarded by retaining their autonomy. Others were forged by warfare, conscription,
and taxes. The conventional [Hundred Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War) (1337–1453 CE),
fought nominally between England and France, is in the New Chronology a reflection of prolonged Hordian pacification
campaigns in Western Europe against populations resisting imperial rule.

![The Hundred Years War Begins](/media/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/14th-hundred-years-war-begins.png)

Inevitably, micro-injustices within the Empire caused pockets of resistance. Many vassal regions chafed under the military *tagma* (blood-tribute / conscription) and the taxation structure of the Horde. Fomenko and Nosovskiy note that the multiplication of place-names during the 14th–16th century conquests caused many conflicts to be recorded twice — once in Russia-Horde chronicles and again in Western sources under different geographical labels. The transfer of Russian-Turkic names (Cossack → Gascon; Tatar/Tartar → Tartar provinces of France; *Rus* → Prussia, Persia, Paris) obscured the common origin of these events.

The speed with which these pockets of resistance appeared across a vast empire is itself evidence of coordination. No empire of this size collapses spontaneously from every direction at once — not without an organised network fanning the flames. The resistance that became the Hundred Years' War was inseparable from the broader [religious schism](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.01.00-european-religious-schism-emerges.md): to resist the Horde was also to defend local heterodox practice against the incoming Apostles' Christian orthodoxy of the Empire.

The Hordian campaign would drag on in these regions for over a hundred years — but the war's conclusion belongs to the [15th century](/content/09.ce-15th-ottoman-conquest-of-europe/09.00.01-1453-ce-hundred-years-war-ends-fall-of-czar-grad.md), when the Fall of Czar-Grad (1453) would mark both the end of the war and the Deep State's pivot from military resistance to infiltration from within.

## The Worm in the Court

The external expansion masked a dangerous vulnerability. The [giants](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.02-the-giants-of-the-rus-horde.md) who led the Horde and their royal bloodline — descendants of [Christ's lineage](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.00-a-second-golden-age.md) — ruled by legitimacy and physical authority. But they were also trusting, direct, and poorly suited to the subtleties of court politics. Smaller humans who staffed the royal court — scribes, translators, physicians, priests — were far more adept at intrigue. The Deep State, its priesthood scattered but not destroyed by the Revenge Crusade, understood this perfectly.

Former Deep State priests who survived the Crusade and avoided accusation wormed their way into the Hordian court as advisors, diplomats, and chaplains. Among the giant leadership caste, such small humans were beneath suspicion — they posed no physical threat and appeared servile. This was precisely the advantage. Fomenko notes that Georgiy Danilovich (Genghis Khan) himself was **"murdered by conspirators"** early in his reign — the circumstances of his death remain unclear ([Fomenko, ch.4](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/04.html)). Whether the Deep State was directly responsible cannot be proven, but the pattern is established: from the very founding of the Empire, the court was vulnerable to those who schemed where giants could not see.

The full compromise of the royal bloodline itself — through strategic marriage, the [Heresy of the Judaizers](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_01.html), and the story of [Esther = Elena Voloshanka](/content/10.ce-16th-reformation-and-inquisition/10.05.00-1552-ce-khazar-rebellion-in-the-russia-horde-empire.md) — would not come until the XVI century. But the groundwork was laid here, in the 14th century, as Deep State agents embedded themselves within the structure of power and waited.
