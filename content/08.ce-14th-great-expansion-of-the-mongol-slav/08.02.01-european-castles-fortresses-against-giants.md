# European Castles — Fortresses Against Giants

## The Standard Narrative Falls Apart

According to mainstream history, European castles were built as "private fortified residences" of feudal lords — military strongholds designed to defend against rival human armies. The entire field of castellology frames castle design through the lens of human-on-human warfare: curtain walls to repel scaling ladders, arrow slits for bowmen, moats to block siege towers, murder holes to pour boiling oil on attackers.

There is one problem with this narrative: **most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges.** Wikipedia's own article on castles, citing Coulson (2003) and other standard references, openly admits this. The "domestic life" of castles is described as "a neglected facet" — neglected because the military interpretation is assumed by default, despite the evidence contradicting it.

If castles were designed for human warfare, they were spectacularly bad at it. When gunpowder artillery arrived in the 15th century, castles that had stood for centuries became indefensible almost overnight. The walls of Constantinople — the finest fortifications in the medieval world — fell to Ottoman cannon in **six weeks** in 1453. Castle after castle across Europe was reduced to rubble by siege guns that the castle designers had never anticipated. The conventional explanation is that "technology changed" — but this dodges the real question: **why were these immense, expensive, centuries-old structures so poorly optimised against the most obvious form of human military threat?**

The answer proposed here: because they were not designed against humans. They were designed against **giants**.

## The Castle-Building Window and the Giant Timeline

The peak of European castle construction spans the **11th through 14th centuries** — precisely the period in which the [Rus-Horde Empire and its giant leadership caste](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.02-the-giants-of-the-rus-horde.md) were active across Eurasia. The [Battle of Kulikovo in 1380](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.00-1380-ce-giants-are-defeated-at-the-battle-of-kulikovo.md) marked the decisive defeat of giants by cannon-equipped human forces — and castle construction entered a sharp decline almost immediately afterward. By the early 15th century, new castles in England and Wales "presented few innovations" and the rate of construction collapsed.

This is not a coincidence. Once the giant threat was neutralised, the enormous expense of castle building was no longer justified. The structures that survived into the gunpowder era were repurposed as residences, administrative centres, and status symbols — which is exactly how most of them appear in the historical record, because by the time anyone was writing that record, the giants were already gone.

## Features That Make Sense Against Giants

Reexamining standard castle features through the giant-defence lens resolves numerous anomalies:

### Elevation and Inaccessibility

Castles were built on **hilltops, cliff edges, rocky outcrops, and tidal islands** — positions that maximise difficulty for a large, heavy creature. A human can scramble up a muddy slope; a 5-to-8-metre giant cannot without enormous exposure.

### Wall Thickness Over Height

Walls were typically **3 metres thick** and 12 metres tall. Against humans with ladders, thickness is wasted — humans go over or under, not through. But against a giant who can **strike or push** a wall, mass is the critical variable. The emphasis on thickness over height is what engineers defending against brute-force impact would produce.

### Narrow Entrances and Passages

Gatehouse **lengthened passages, multiple portcullises, and sharp turns** would be devastatingly effective against giants: a creature of enormous size **physically cannot fit** through a narrow, turning passage. The gatehouse becomes a geometric filter that excludes the primary threat.

### Moats — Body Traps for Oversized Creatures

No significant medieval siege was decided by a moat alone — human armies routinely filled, bridged, or drained them. Against a giant, however, a wide deep ditch is devastating: a creature weighing several times more than a human sinks in soft ground and becomes exposed to sustained fire.

### Keeps and Tower Houses

Keep entrances were on the **second storey** (accessible only by removable ladders), internal spaces were divided by narrow partitions, and spiral staircases **physically exclude** any creature too large to fit. Against a giant, the spiral staircase is not a marginal advantage — it is an absolute barrier.

## Castle Stalker — Case Study

[Castle Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Stalker) is a four-storey tower house on a **tidal islet** in Loch Laich, Argyll, Scotland — built c. 1320 by Clan MacDougall and rebuilt in the 1440s. It is maximally defensible against a large land creature but minimally defensible against humans with boats. In 700 years it has **never been sieged** — it changed hands c. 1620 through a **drunken bet**, not warfare. The name derives from Gaelic *Stalcaire* ("hunter/falconer"), suggesting a **hunting lodge** in territory where the "wildlife" required stone walls and a tidal moat. It appeared as the Castle of Aaaarrrrggh in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (1975) — even in parody, cultural memory acknowledges the absurdity of sieging an island tower with a human army.

## The Pattern Across Europe

Hundreds of tower houses across Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and western France share this profile: remote inaccessible locations, disproportionately thick walls, virtually no military history, and transition to residential use once the original threat diminished. Wikipedia estimates **75,000–100,000 castles** were built across western Europe — a number that defies any purely military explanation for inter-human warfare, but makes sense for a continent shared with giants.

## The Gunpowder Transition

Once cannon proliferated, castles were abandoned wholesale rather than adapted — replaced by low-profile star forts with completely different design philosophy (angled walls, geometric firing lanes). This discontinuity is not evolution but **replacement**: two different engineering responses to two different threats. If castles had been designed against human armies, their builders would have iteratively evolved them against each new siege technique. Instead, [once cannon defeated the giants at Kulikovo (1380)](/content/08.ce-14th-great-expansion-of-the-mongol-slav/08.02.00-1380-ce-giants-are-defeated-at-the-battle-of-kulikovo.md) and the giant population declined, the castles had served their purpose.

## Outstanding Questions

Further investigation is needed into: giant remains in castle archaeological contexts (systematic suppression consistent with [broader concealment patterns](/content/07.ce-13th-the-russian-horde-tartarian-empire/07.01.02-the-giants-of-the-rus-horde.md)); geographic correlation between castle density and giant-related folklore/evidence; Asian and Middle Eastern equivalents (Central Asian fortified monasteries); and whether features like fire-resistant construction address threats beyond giants (the "wildlife" of medieval bestiaries).
