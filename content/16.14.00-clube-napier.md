# Victor Clube & Bill Napier

**Victor Clube:** Oxford University astrophysicist  
**Bill Napier:** Armagh Observatory astronomer  
**Fields:** Observational astronomy, cometary dynamics, cosmic catastrophism

## Primary Contribution

Mainstream astronomical confirmation of catastrophic comet-swarm events within recorded human history. Clube and Napier argued within the conventional scientific framework that a giant comet entered the inner solar system within the last 20,000–30,000 years, fragmented, and produced a debris stream that bombarded Earth in multiple episodes throughout human prehistory and history.

## Framework: Coherent Catastrophism

- **The Taurid Complex** — the present-day Taurid meteor stream is the remnant of a giant comet (est. 50–100 km diameter) that entered the solar system ~20,000–30,000 years ago and fragmented progressively over millennia
- **Coherent catastrophism** — periodic encounters with the Taurid debris stream would produce catastrophic bombardment events on a cycle of centuries to millennia — not the rare, random-impact model of standard geology
- **Historical catastrophe within civilization** — the Bronze Age Collapse (~1200 BCE), the Roman Dark Age, and the early medieval dark horizon are all Taurid bombardment events, not social collapse
- **Sky religion as bombardment memory** — dragon myths, sky-serpent traditions, and comet-worship across cultures are records of actual cometary apparitions, not pure myth

## Special Significance

Clube and Napier are notable because they reached catastrophist conclusions from within conventional mainstream astronomy — making their work harder to dismiss on institutional grounds. They used standard astronomical methods (orbital mechanics, meteor stream dynamics, crater dating) to argue for catastrophic bombardment of historical civilizations.

Their Taurid Complex model is the astronomical mechanism behind Hancock's Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.
