# The length of a year was 225 days

Saturn was called [Kronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus), the *God before time began*. Before clocks and calendars, planetary positions were the only way to tell time. Saturn's system was now orbiting our Sun — time began. Our current Sun was still hidden behind Saturn (and Jupiter). As Earth's spin did not change significantly, a "day" remained constant, but the length of a year was 225 days — 40% *faster* than our current 365.25-day orbit. Year-lengths changed periodically and suddenly as Earth jumped between orbits, each jump drawing less solar energy and producing a slower orbit.

## Kronos = Time

Saturn or Kronos translates to "time." The visible crescent of Saturn — lit by the real Sun on Saturn's rim — was the first clock. As Earth rotated beneath Saturn, this crescent swept counterclockwise, brightening at night and dimming by day.

> *"We can actually claim that Saturn invented time — when it no longer blazed, but had reduced its output or dropped to dark mode. That is when a crescent would be seen at the edge of the globe, rotating counterclockwise on a daily basis."*
> — Jno Cook, *Saturnian Cosmology*, Chapter 14

Saturn literally preceded the age of measurable time — it *was* the mechanism that made time visible. When Jupiter displaced Saturn after 3147 BC, Jupiter replaced "the older God of Time and Beginnings."

## The 225-Day Year: Evidence from the Sumerian King-List

The figure of 225 days is derived from the Sumerian *List of Kings Before the Flood* — dismissed as fantastical because reigns run into tens of thousands of "years." Cook argues these figures record *days*, not years, and only a 225-day year resolves the totals into whole-number multiples of **32 years**:

| King | City | Sars | Days | 225d/yr | ×32 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alulim | Eridug | 8 | 28,800 | 128 yr | 4 |
| Alaljar | Eridug | 10 | 36,000 | 160 yr | 5 |
| Enmenluana | Bad-Tibira | 12 | 43,200 | 192 yr | 6 |
| Enmengalana | Bad-Tibira | 8 | 28,800 | 128 yr | 4 |
| Dumuzid | Bad-Tibira | 10 | 36,000 | 160 yr | 5 |

Grand total: **241,200 days = 1,072 years** of kings before the flood at 225 days/year.

## Orbital Mechanics: 0.72 AU

A 225-day year corresponds to an average orbital distance of **0.72 AU** — almost exactly Venus's current orbit. Cook (*Appendix B: Celestial Mechanics*) calculates: assuming eccentricity of 0.25, perihelion at 0.54 AU and aphelion at 0.9 AU. Kepler's third law gives a 0.70-AU orbit ~214 days — consistent with 225 for a slightly more distant path.

## The Complete Progression of Year-Lengths

Each step corresponds to a catastrophic event in myth and archaeology:

| Period (BC) | Days/Year | Orbit (AU) | Era |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8347–3147 | **225** | 0.72 | Second Creation (Saturn in sky) |
| 3147–2349 | 240 | 0.75 | Old Kingdom (after Flood) |
| 2349–2193 | 260 | 0.79 | Fall of the Absu |
| 2193–1492 | 273 | 0.83 | Middle Kingdom |
| 1492–747 | 360 | 0.99 | New Kingdom |
| 747–today | 365.24 | 1.00 | Current era |

*Source: Cook, Saturnian Cosmology, Appendix A.*

The 360→365.24 jump (747 BC) is corroborated by calendar reforms across Egyptian, Roman, Greek, and Mesopotamian civilizations in the 8th–7th centuries BC.

## Carbon-14 Corroboration

Cook's calculated date corrections — derived purely from shorter orbital years — track closely with calibrated C-14 fluctuations:

| Solar BC | Days/yr | CalcΔ (yrs) | C14 BP | C14Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| -4075 | 225 | 862 | 6030 | 712 |
| -3145 | 240 | 505 | 5100 | 563 |
| -1495 | 360 | 10.8 | 3450 | 235 |
| -745 | 365.24 | 0 | 2700 | 245 |

The shorter-year chronology is not only internally consistent with ancient king-lists but independently supported by isotope physics — radiocarbon calibration curves inadvertently capture the same orbital history.

## The Era of 225 Days: 8347–3147 BC

This 5,200-year span is Cook's "Second Creation" — the *Era of the Gods* of Sumerian mythology, when Saturn stood in the northern sky, Mars and Venus between it and Earth, and the plasma stalk connected them all. The Olmec, Maya, Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Norse records all describe the same sky.
