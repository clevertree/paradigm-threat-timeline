# Atlantis and the Tree of Knowledge

![Atlantis - First Jerusalem built on the north poles of Mars and Earth](/media/02.the-golden-age/atlantis_first_jerusalem.png)
*Atlantis was the first holy city - First Jerusalem - built on the north poles of Mars and Earth to harness the energy of the Collinear Configuration and Golden Age.*

The planets in the northern configuration created a spectacular **Tree of Life** display directly above the continent of [Atlantis](https://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=201407156476.the_lost_continent_of_the_arctic) and its three major cities **Og**, **Aryan**, and the 'Emerald City' of **Poseida**. Poseida, the capital, existed at the continent's centre as a massive pyramid or ziggurat built from [grown emeralds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald#Synthetic_emerald) — maximizing conductivity of cosmic energy streaming from the planetary configuration. Its rulers, the self-appointed 'upper class,' jealously guarded their inventions until the city became known as the **Tree of Knowledge**. After the fall, these elites escaped with their knowledge, founding the **Pyramidal Empire**.

## Plato's Description Cannot Be Located on Earth

The only ancient account of Atlantis comes from Plato's *Timaeus* and *Critias* (c. 360 BCE). Read literally, his description is geographically impossible for any location on present-day Earth — but entirely consistent with a city at the **north pole of Mars**, elevated above the Earth in the collinear configuration.

**The island was larger than Libya and Asia combined** (*Timaeus* 24e–25a). No landmass in any ocean satisfies this. The ocean floor has been mapped — no such continent exists. But in the Saturnian framework, **Mars** during the Golden Age was nearly as large as Earth, accessible from Earth's north pole via the plasma column. The "Pillars of Heracles" mark the terrestrial end of the quantum bridge; the "other islands" are intermediate plasma bodies; the "whole continent" is Mars itself.

**"Ships and voyages were not yet"** (*Critias* 113e–114a). If Atlantis couldn't be reached by ship, it wasn't a mid-Atlantic island. Plato describes a place reached by entirely different means — the **Bifröst**, the natural plasma bridge along the magnetic axis of the planetary column.

**Concentric rings around a central hill, "sheltered from the north"** (*Critias* 113d–116a, 118b–c). A city arranged as concentric rings around a north pole, with the continent falling away southward, matches the **Martian north polar cap** geometry exactly. Orichalcum, Plato's mysterious second-most-precious metal "dug out of the earth in many parts of the island" (*Critias* 116a), has never been identified in any geological record on Earth — consistent with a mineral unique to the Martian surface.

**Repeated catastrophes** (*Critias* 111–112). The Egyptian priests confirmed cyclical planetary destruction: Atlantis was not a sunken island but a peer civilization to Athens, destroyed during the collapse of the Saturn-system column (c. 3147 BCE) and the Flood that accompanied Mars' departure from co-linear orbit.

## The First Jews of Atlantis (First Jerusalem)

The term 'Jew' refers to anyone worshiping Saturn as a Creator God (YHWH, El, Elohim, Ba'al, HaShem). The priest class (Rabbis, Pharisees) claims to execute God's Authority over all aspects of life — finance, food, procreation, death — forming the protective outer layer of the **Pyramidal Empire** throughout history.

By keeping strict lineage separation, Jews passed down inherited authority over centuries. They appear to have no origin or homeland because their first appearance was before the fall of Atlantis, when they represented a priest class exchanging advanced technology for obedience. Abrahamic religions remember this as the Garden of Eden, and Atlantis as the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil). This is also reflected in *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* — see [Predictive Programming](/content/15.ce-21st-the-final-struggle/15.01.00-predictive-programming-fiction-as-control.md#the-wizard-of-oz-atlantis-disguised-as-childrens-entertainment).

## Open Investigation: The City Names Og, Aryan, and Poseida

These three names do not appear in Plato or any surviving ancient primary source. They make structural sense — **Og** maps onto the biblical giant-king tradition; **Aryan** onto the Indo-Iranian root-civilization concept; **Poseida** onto Poseidon's domain — but their earliest traceable appearances are in 19th–21st century non-canonical sources. Provenance is complicated by denazification-era document destruction (Himmler's *Ahnenerbe* research, 1935–1945) and possible Nazi-era back-projection. **This investigation is ongoing.** See [Outstanding Questions](/docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md).

> **Sources traced:** *Og*: [Og of Bashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og), [Book of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Giants) (DSS 4Q531); city application from [Earth-Keeper Chronicles](https://www.earth-keeper.com/). *Aryan*: [Blavatsky, *The Secret Doctrine* (1888)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky), fifth root race; city application unlocated. *Poseida*: [Edgar Cayce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Cayce) A.R.E. readings, 364-series (1923–1944); elaborated by James Tyberonn.
