# Atlantis and the Tree of Knowledge

![Atlantis - First Jerusalem built on the north poles of Mars and Earth](/media/02.the-golden-age/atlantis_first_jerusalem.png)
*Atlantis was the first holy city - First Jerusalem - built on the north poles of Mars and Earth to harness the energy of the Collinear Configuration and Golden Age.*

The planets in the northern configuration created a spectacular **Tree of Life** display which appeared directly above the
continent of [Atlantis](https://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=201407156476.the_lost_continent_of_the_arctic), and its three
major cities **Og**, **Aryan**, and the 'Emerald City' of **Poseida**. The city of Aryan was
the largest and most populated city. The city of Poseida was the capital of Atlantis and existed
at the very center of the continent appearing as a massive pyramid or ziggurat built out
of [grown emeralds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald#Synthetic_emerald). This construction allowed for maximized
conductivity of the cosmic currents of energy streaming into it from the planetary configuration. The rulers of this
city considered themselves the 'upper class' of the human race, and jealously guarded all of their inventions and
knowledge until the city itself became known as the **Tree of Knowledge**. After the fall of Atlantis, the upper-class
citizenry escaped, preserving their knowledge (_and class-system_)
in the secret places of the world. This was the beginning of the so-called **Pyramidal Empire**.

## Plato's Description Cannot Be Located on Earth

The only ancient written account of Atlantis comes from Plato's dialogues *Timaeus* and *Critias* (c. 360 BCE), where he records the story as transmitted by the Egyptian priests to the Athenian statesman Solon. Read literally, Plato's description contains details that are geometrically and geographically impossible for any location on the present-day Earth — but are entirely consistent with a city existing at the **north pole of Mars**, elevated above the Earth in the collinear configuration of the Golden Age.

### The Island Was Larger Than Libya and Asia Combined

The most striking impossibility is the sheer scale Plato attributes to Atlantis. In *Timaeus* (24e–25a), the Egyptian priest tells Solon:

> *"For in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent."*
> — *Timaeus*, 24e–25a (Plato, trans. Jowett)

No landmass in the Atlantic Ocean satisfies this description. "Libya and Asia together" encompassed nearly the entire known world. A continent *larger* than those two combined cannot be concealed beneath any ocean on Earth — the ocean floor has been mapped in sufficient resolution to rule it out entirely. Modern geology confirms no such landmass subducted in any historically recent period.

However, in the Saturnian cosmology framework, this description fits precisely: **Mars** during the Golden Age was a body *nearly as large as Earth*, visible and accessible from Earth's north pole via the plasma column. The "Pillars of Heracles" in this reading mark the terrestrial end of the quantum bridge — the magnetic tube that connected Earth's north pole upward through the configuration to the community of worlds above. The "other islands" Plato describes as stepping stones are the intermediate plasma bodies and moons in the collinear stack, and the "whole continent" at the far end is Mars itself.

### "Ships and Voyages Were Not Yet"

In *Critias* (113e–114a), Plato describes how Poseidon fortified the central hill of Atlantis:

> *"Poseidon, as a token of his love, enclosed the hill in which she dwelt all round, making alternate zones of sea and land larger and smaller, encircling one another; there were two of land and three of water, which he turned as with a lathe, each having its circumference equidistant every way from the centre, so that no man could get to the island, for ships and voyages were not yet."*
> — *Critias*, 113e–114a

The admission that **"ships and voyages were not yet"** is catastrophic to any conventional maritime hypothesis. If Atlantis could not be reached by ship, it could not have been a mid-Atlantic island accessible from the Mediterranean. Plato is plainly describing a place that was reached by an entirely different means of travel — one that predated the sea-going civilization we know. In the Saturnian cosmology model, that means of travel was the **Bifröst** — the natural plasma bridge (quantum gate) formed along the magnetic axis of the planetary column, allowing instantaneous transit between the north pole of Earth and the north pole of Mars.

### The Concentric Rings Match a Polar Configuration

Plato's *Critias* (113d–116a) describes the capital city of Atlantis in unusual geometric detail: a central hill of modest height surrounded by precisely machined concentric rings of alternating water and land, all perfectly equidistant from the center, as if turned on a lathe. The entire structure was oriented toward and **sheltered from the north**:

> *"The whole country was said by him to be very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea, but the country immediately about and surrounding the city was a level plain... This whole region of the island lay towards the south, and was sheltered from the north."*
> — *Critias*, 118b–c

A city arranged as concentric rings around a north pole, with the continent falling away to the south, is the **exact geometry expected of the Martian north polar cap** as seen from the collinear configuration below. The "sea" surrounding each ring could refer to a plasma ocean (the *Absu* of Sumerian cosmology) rather than liquid water. Orichalcum, Plato's mysterious second-most-precious metal that *"was dug out of the earth in many parts of the island"* (*Critias*, 116a), has never been identified in any geological record on Earth — consistent with a mineral unique to the Martian surface.

### The Egyptian Priests Confirm Repeated Catastrophes

The same Egyptian sources that delivered the Atlantis account to Solon also explicitly described the cyclical planetary catastrophes that ended each age. Plato records their words in *Critias* 111–112:

> *"Many great deluges have taken place during the years since Athens and Atlantis were preeminent. Destruction by fire and other catastrophes was also common... The floods, especially the third great flood before Deucalion, washed away most of Athens' fertile soil."*
> — *Critias*, 111–112

This framing — Atlantis as a *peer civilization to Athens*, destroyed by the same global catastrophes — places its fall squarely in the period of planetary upheaval following the dissolution of the collinear configuration (c. 3147 BCE). The Egyptian priests were not describing a sunken island. They were describing the **end of the Golden Age**: the collapse of the Saturn-system column, the Flood that accompanied Mars' departure from co-linear orbit, and the loss of the quantum bridge that made Atlantis reachable. No writer prior to Plato mentions Atlantis — not Homer, Pindar, Herodotus, nor Aristotle — reflecting that direct knowledge of the Golden Age had already been sealed away by the Atlantean priest class.

## The First Jews of Atlantis (First Jerusalem)

The term 'Jew' refers to anyone who worships the planet Saturn as a *Creator God* (YHWH, Adonai, El, Elohim, Jehovah, Ba'al, or simply HaShem — "The Name"). In history, 'Jew' refers to a closed society claiming to have *been chosen by* that Creator God. The priest class of this society (Rabbis, Pharisees) seek to execute _God's Authority_ over all aspects of life — finance, food, procreation, death — even over humans outside their society (gentiles). They operate at the highest levels of society and form the protective outer layer of the **Pyramidal Empire** throughout history.

By keeping strict separation between their lineage and outsiders, Jews passed down inherited authority over centuries. They appear to have no origin or homeland because their first appearance was before the fall of Atlantis, when they represented a priest class exchanging advanced technology as gifts for obedience to their authority and the authority of Saturn.

Abrahamic religions remember this as the Garden of Eden, and the city of Atlantis as the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil). This story is also reflected in *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* — see [Predictive Programming: Fiction as Control](/content/15.ce-21st-the-final-struggle/15.01.00-predictive-programming-fiction-as-control.md#the-wizard-of-oz-atlantis-disguised-as-childrens-entertainment) for the full analysis.


## Open Investigation: The City Names Og, Aryan, and Poseida

The three city names — **Og**, **Aryan**, and **Poseida** — do not appear in Plato nor in any surviving ancient primary source as named cities of Atlantis. Their earliest traceable appearances are in 19th–21st century non-canonical sources. This does not mean the names are wrong — it means the trail has been interrupted. The names make considerable structural sense: **Og** maps onto the biblical giant-king tradition and the Rephaim; **Aryan** (in the oldest Indo-Iranian sense of *noble/original*) maps onto the root-civilization concept; **Poseida** maps directly onto Poseidon's domain from Plato's own *Critias*.

The provenance is complicated by two layers of redaction. First, the **denazification era (1945–1951)**: the Nazis mounted serious research into Aryan prehistory and Atlantis (Himmler's *Ahnenerbe*, 1935–1945), and thousands of documents were destroyed, classified, or scattered after the war. If genuine pre-classical sources naming these cities were recovered, they would have been among the first materials suppressed. Second, the *Ahnenerbe* was not above fabricating sources to serve racial ideology — *Aryan* as a city name may well be a Nazi-era back-projection. Neither possibility can be ruled out.

Every significant city carries multiple names across cultures: Constantinople was also Byzantium, New Rome, Istanbul. Og, Aryan, and Poseida may be accurate, garbled, translated, or retrospective names. **This investigation is ongoing.** See [Outstanding Questions](/docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md).

> **Sources traced so far:**
> - *Og*: [Og of Bashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og) (*Numbers* 21:33; *Deuteronomy* 3:1–11); [Book of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Giants) (Dead Sea Scrolls, 4Q531). City application: [Earth-Keeper Chronicles](https://www.earth-keeper.com/) (2000s, channeled).
> - *Aryan*: [Blavatsky, *The Secret Doctrine* (1888)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky) — fifth root race (post-Atlantean successor), not a city. City application: unlocated; likely New Age synthesis.
> - *Poseida*: [Edgar Cayce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Cayce) A.R.E. readings, 364-series (1923–1944) — "Poseidia" as primary Atlantean island-continent. Elaborated by James Tyberonn ([archived](https://dailymassmeditation.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/3501/)).
