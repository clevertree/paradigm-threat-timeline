# The Absu layers surrounded the Planets

Visible on Earth's Southern Hemisphere was "[the Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php)", also called "The Abyss" or [Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament). This 'seal' represented outer layers of Saturn's plasma sheath, appearing as obscuring equatorial rings — a cosmic 'sea' in the southern sky. [Jno Cook](https://jnocook.net/) describes it:

> "I had no trouble identifying the Sumerian Absu, the Egyptian Duat, and the Maya House of Nine Bushes as a set of rings seen in the southern night sky. The rings were universally understood to be an ocean standing up from the south horizon."

## What the Absu Was

"Absu" is Mesopotamian for "Abyss — the Deep." Earth possessed concentric equatorial plasma rings — analogous to Saturn's rings today — during the polar configuration. From [Chapter 12](https://saturniancosmology.org/arch.php.html): *"People in the northern hemisphere would have seen the rings in the southern skies at night... standing 40–50 degrees up, arcing from east to west. At night the Absu was brilliant — lighted directly by the Sun."*

The rings predated 3147 BC and persisted until **2349 BC**, when they fell — the **Flood of Noah**.

## Ring Count by Latitude

The number of rings varies by culture because more became visible closer to the equator:

| Culture | Latitude | Rings | Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sumer/Egypt | ~30°N | 7 | Absu / Duat |
| Greece/Sicily | ~37°N | 6 | Scylla's six heads |
| Poverty Point, Louisiana | 33°N | 6 | Six earthwork berms |
| Maya/Olmec | ~20°N | 9 | House of Nine Bushes |

The **Odyssey's** six-headed Scylla matches the six rings visible from Sicily — same as the six earthwork rings at Poverty Point at identical latitude.

## The Shadow Doorway — Gate of the Gods

Earth's shadow fell across the rings each night, creating a moving arched gap — a **doorway or gate**. At the equinoxes it widened into a giant trapezoid. The Egyptians called this the "doorway of the Duat" where Gods and dead pharaohs traveled by boat. The Akkadians read an ancient site as **"Gate of the Gods"** — Bab-ili, *Babylon*. The Mesoamerican **ballcourt** architecturally represents this shadow gap.

## Cross-Cultural Names

| Tradition | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sumerian | Absu | Seven rings; assigned to God Enki |
| Egyptian | Duat | Seven mansions / qerert (circles) |
| Hebrew/Bible | Firmament | "Waters above the firmament" (Gen 1:7) |
| Maya | House of Nine Bushes | Nine rings visible from Yucatan |
| Norse | Nine Worlds | Ring layers as multiple cosmos |

## The Fall of the Absu — 2349 BC

The Absu collapsed catastrophically in 2349 BC — the **Flood of Noah** ([Chapter 30](https://saturniancosmology.org/chil.php.html)): *"The Absu turned red, lightning fired across the rings. The rings disappeared, and the southern stars first showed. Most prominent was the Pleiades — an event continued as signal for 'Day of the Dead' worldwide."*

**Sequence:** Jupiter exits Asteroid Belt → develops massive plasma plume → giant lightning bolt (thunderbolt of the Gods) → nine lesser bolts follow → Absu turns red → rings collapse, raining water onto Earth → Pleiades and southern stars appear → Moon settles into regular orbit.

## Archaeological Evidence

Structures worldwide commemorate the Absu: **Poverty Point** (6 concentric earthworks, 33°N); **Mesoamerican ballcourts** (equinox shadow gap); **Egyptian pylons** (Duat shadow boundary); **Amphitheater form** universally replicates the arched southern ring-sea.
