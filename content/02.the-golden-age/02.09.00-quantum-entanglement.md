# The Interplanetary Quantum Entanglement

During the Golden Age, high-amplitude, low-voltage energy flowed through each planet in the configuration the Norse called "The Bifröst." As the planets did not spin, each pole acted as a strong [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) between worlds. Building pyramidal structures at these locations enabled humans to **travel instantaneously** through the Bifröst. Egyptian mythology's ["Boat of Ra"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_barque) — which [transported Ra between planets](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/) — looks strikingly like a modern depiction of a wormhole:

## The Plasma Column as Trans-Planetary Bridge

The Saturnian Cosmology model identifies the physical mechanism: a sustained **plasma stream** in arc mode connecting Saturn's polar axis to Earth's north magnetic pole — a visible, luminous, electrically-active column. Different cultures recorded it under different names, all describing the same phenomenon.

### Bifröst — The Norse Bridge

The Norse *Eddas* describe the plasma stream as the bridge Bifrost between Earth (Midgard) and the "Other World" (Asgard). From the north Atlantic, the stream appeared as an arch spanning the heavens from the southwest to Saturn overhead. Norse legends also describe it as an **inverted tree with roots at the top** — exactly what a plasma column breaking into streamers would look like. This is the **World Tree** (*Yggdrasil*) and the **Axis Mundi** of dozens of cultures.

### The Rainbow — A Misidentified Plasma Plume

The "rainbow as divine covenant" (Genesis/Noah, *Enuma Elish*) is a mistranslation. In the *Enuma Elish*, Marduk (Jupiter) plants his "war bow" in the sky after the flood — a **south polar plasma plume** standing vertically, not a horizontal arc of refracted sunlight. The sign given to Noah was likely the reappearance of polar plasma plumes after orbital disruption.

### Rainbow Serpent — Polar Plume as Sky-Arch

The Australian Aboriginal Rainbow Serpent and the North American Great Horned Serpent are identified with the **north polar plasma plume**, which appeared each time Earth's orbit shifted. The serpent-form (a luminous arch) combined with auroral colours produced the universal "rainbow serpent" archetype across unconnected cultures.

### Boat of Ra — Saturn's Plasma Crescent

David Talbott identifies the Egyptian Boat of Ra as the visual appearance of a **crescent of plasma light revolving around Saturn** — not the Sun. Egyptian descriptions have the Boat sailing through the sky *at night* and journeying through the underworld *during the day* — the opposite of solar behaviour — confirming it tracked Saturn. The dead traveled the Boat of Ra to reach Osiris: the polar plasma bridge as literal passage between worlds.

### Eye of Ra — The Polar Alignment

The Eye of Ra (*Wedjat*) records the polar alignment seen from Earth: Saturn as the eyeball, Mercury as the iris, Mars as the pupil, with Saturn's rings forming almond-shaped lids and a plasma stream extending downward as the Eye's tail. The **uraeus** (cobra) on the pharaoh's crown is the same symbol — the plasma stream from Saturn's pole descending to Earth.
