# Napoleonic Wars

The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) were the final major armed conflict of the post-Hordian transition period — the last attempt to create a unified continental European power that could resist the emerging hegemony of the City of London's financial empire. Napoleon Bonaparte's campaigns swept across the ruins of the old Imperial territories, dismantling the remnants of feudal aristocracy and replacing them with the Napoleonic Code — a rationalized legal system based on property rights, secular governance, and civil equality that the old Hordian order had never required because it governed by genealogical principle.

## Napoleon and the Financial Revolution

Napoleon's relationship to the financial restructuring of Europe was paradoxical. On one hand, he abolished the [Inquisition in Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) in 1806, liberated Jewish populations across Europe, and promoted their legal equality as citizens of the French Empire. Historian Patrice Gueniffey notes:

> *"He was, I think, ultimately rather good [for the Jews], because his policies for the Jewish community in France and the Empire promoted their assimilation into the French nation. The French revolution liberated the Jews but did not assimilate them. Napoleon took up the case again and decided to do for the Jews what he had done for other religions."*

On the other hand, Napoleon's central bank project competed directly with the Bank of England's debt-based system. His [Continental System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System) — an attempted economic blockade of British goods from the European continent — was designed to destroy the financial dominance of the City of London. This is the real reason the British never stopped fighting him, even when every military option had been exhausted. The Napoleonic Wars were, at their core, a war between two financial systems: the Napoleonic Code's property-based order and the Bank of England's debt-based empire.

## The Revolutionary Prelude

The French Revolutionary Wars that preceded Napoleon's rise (1792–1797) were the military phase of France's transition from monarchical to financial governance. The key sequence:

- **1790**: France bans usury; Church taxes canceled; Church property nationalized
- **1792**: First Coalition against Revolutionary France forms (Austria, Prussia, Britain, Spain)
- **1793**: Royalist invasion crushed at Toulon; Napoleon gains national fame
- **1799**: Napoleon seizes power in the [Coup of 18 Brumaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_Brumaire)
- **1804**: Napoleon becomes Emperor of the French

The Jacobins who radicalized the Revolution and introduced the *Guerre Totale* (total war) and *levée en masse* (mass conscription) represent the same financial-revolutionary class that had already transformed England. But France, unlike England, had a military genius available to reorganize the resulting chaos into genuine state power — rather than simply replacing aristocratic governance with financial governance.

## Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign and the Real Ancient History

Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign (1798–1801) was nominally a military operation to threaten British India by controlling the eastern Mediterranean. In the NC context, it had a second significance: it brought French scholars face-to-face with the physical ruins of what the Scaligerian chronology claimed was "ancient Egypt," producing the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) and the Description de l'Égypte — the first systematic inventory of Egyptian monuments. From the NC perspective, these ruins were *much more recent* than the conventional chronology allowed, and the archaeological team was unknowingly documenting the material legacy of the Hordian Imperial cemetery system.

## The Continental and Anti-Continental Coalitions

France faced **seven successive coalitions** organized by Britain and financed by the City of London. Each coalition was broken militarily by Napoleon; each was reassembled through new British subsidies. The pattern reveals the fundamental asymmetry: Napoleon could win every battle and still lose, because he was fighting an enemy whose primary weapon was credit, not armies. Britain paid Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Spain to field armies that Napoleon then destroyed — and then paid them again to field new ones.

The Romanov-British strategic partnership during this period is critical context: the same Romanov dynasty that had recently partitioned Moscow Tartary with the new United States was now serving as the eastern arm of the British containment strategy against Napoleon. The 1812 Russian campaign was not a Russian victory of military genius but the result of deliberate scorched-earth strategy combined with the climate — and the political impossibility of Napoleon permanently occupying Moscow without triggering the Romanov-British alliance's full resource mobilization.

## The Aftermath: Restored Order and Managed States

The [Congress of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna) (1814–1815) restored the European monarchies that Napoleon had abolished, with one crucial difference: every restored monarchy now operated within a framework of national debt to international banking houses (principally the Rothschilds, who had funded multiple sides of the wars and emerged as the dominant European financial power in their aftermath). The political independence of the restored states was real; their financial independence was not. The post-Napoleonic order was the Westphalian system completed: sovereign states whose sovereignty was exercised within boundaries set by the creditors who financed them.
