# Heresy of the Judaizers

While Western Romanov / Scalagerian history praises the Protestant Reformation as good and criticizes the Inquisition as
bad, the opposite perspective was held in the east-that the Inquisition was necessary, and that the Protestant
Reformation was a *heresy* of a new emerging religion called **Judaism**.

A direct result of the 1492 Apocalypse was the idealization of God's Authority in the Rus-Horde Empire as the
Monotheists cemented in place the idea that their first Tsar Andronicus-Christ was of the fictional King David
bloodline. The Tsar's family had expanded considerably since the founding of the Empire and as a result, many people
grew up believing they were of a bloodline *chosen* by God and traceable to King David. Faith in this belief became
the *foundation* of modern Judaism. Naturally, people not of this bloodline tended to disagree with that perspective.
Some claimed it was religious heresy. Others simply disagreed with the Jews when it came to their claims of authority
over finance, meat production, and world religion. Until this point, the inner functions of Deep State Monotheism
operated in secret, but merging with Eastern religions subjected Monotheism to severe scrutiny by the non -
priesthood and public. Thus began the [disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews) between the Jews
and [Gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy) which led to [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom).

*Catharism was a [dualist gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) movement based on the teachings of [Mary Magdalene](https://www.joannakujawa.com/mary-magdalene-the-heretics-kings-and-lovers/) that spread from the Crimea to southern Europe before being systematically [annihilated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Annihilation) and redacted into the Christian Bible and Islamic [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_in_Islam). This is why both major religious texts consider Mary Magdalene to be exalted among women. Catharism emphasised personal spiritual knowledge (Gnosis) and [rejects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Organization) every 'orthodox' belief system and ritual practiced by the Catholic Church. Cathars considered religions inspired by Saturn (Satan) to be materialistic and evil. They viewed the Church of Satan as a plague, and the Church viewed them as a threat. When the Church sent [Languedoc Knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade) to [convert or kill](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mvnct.7) the Cathar heretics of southern France, the Knights replied: "We cannot. We have been reared in their midst. We have relatives among them and we see them living lives of perfection."*
