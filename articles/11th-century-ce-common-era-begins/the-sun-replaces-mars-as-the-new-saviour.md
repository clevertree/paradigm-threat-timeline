# The Sun replaces Mars as the new Saviour

Humans would begin to debate the meaning of this new post-*creation* period.
[Solar deity worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity)
took center stage in all world religions including in Africa, Greece, Armenia, Arabia, Aztec mythology, Baltic
mythology, Buddhism, Celtic, Chinese mythology, Christianity, Greece, Hinduism and Indian mythology, Incan and
Indonesian mythology, and Yazidism. Sun worship posed a problem for the Deep State as this new God indeed seemed to be greater than those they used to
worship. The [Central Tenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_have_no_other_gods_before_me)
of the **Deep State** religion, [Deuteronomy 6:14-16](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm) warns:

> Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you.
> For the LORD your God, **who is among you**, is a jealous God.
> Otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you,
> **and He will wipe you off the face of the earth**.


With the dramatic appearance of each new Saviour planet (Jupiter, Venus, Mars, the Sun), the Deep State would lose
control over world religion once again. They would have no choice but to tie the new Saviour back to the old Creator in
an attempt to regain control (Christ-Son of Yahweh. Thor-Son of Odin etc.). However, it would be hard to convince
the masses that our Sun was the *son* of some *invisible deity* i.e. Saturn.
