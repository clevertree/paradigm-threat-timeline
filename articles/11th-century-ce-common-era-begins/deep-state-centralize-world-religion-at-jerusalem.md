# Deep State Centralize World Religion at Jerusalem

After roughly 822 years in exile, it was time for the Deep State to resurface, rebuild their Monotheistic slave empire,
and claim sole authority to speak for the Creator God of the Universe. To this end, the Deep State built a new
headquarters in the narrowest part of the Bosphorus river in north-west Istanbul, a strategically advantageous location.
There they built a metropolis called Yoros in Turkish, Hierosolyma in Latin,
and [Kiev / Tsar-Grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsargrad) (City of the Czar) in Cyrillic text. In *redacted* Greek
Mythology, it was remembered as Troia or Troy. In its time this was the holiest city on Earth - because it was modeled
after the Heavenly Jerusalem described in the [holy texts](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html). This model
*(6 gates and 3 walls)* was first seen as a series of hexagons surrounding the brown-dwarf Saturn in the Golden Age
during the Collinear configuration of planets and is still
seen [today](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/saturn/hexagon-in-motion/). In old versions of
Jerusalem, each of the 3 *walls* had 6 gates resulting in the number **6-6-6** found in literature and often
associated with [Satan](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-connection-between-Satan-and-Saturn) i.e. Saturn.

The invention of the *fixed* calendar provided the Deep State with a new system of faith based on the concept of
constancy - that things change very slowly over time, or not at all. Jerusalem #1 in Istanbul was
renamed [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople), and became the headquarters of the new faith.
Since all information on the old Gods were kept secret in Jerusalem archives, the common people gradually forgot about
them. The stories fell into mythology, replaced by new stories of the Sun traversing the seasons, which later became
the [farmer's almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac).

*Christ was a hairy human giant. Here is a painting of his hairy giant mother from the Body and Soul exhibit in Italy. "I went to see the exhibition 'Body and Soul: Sculpture in Italy from Donatello to Michelangelo,' and this was the first I had ever heard of the miraculous body hair of Mary Magdalene! I mean, what? I guess Christians already knew about this? That she's supposed to have lived in the desert until her clothes crumbled away, then her own body hair miraculously grew to clothe her? Why hasn't this found its way into a short story I've read? Did everyone just know this already?" — [@summerbrennan](https://twitter.com/summerbrennan/status/1406610171934224386)*
