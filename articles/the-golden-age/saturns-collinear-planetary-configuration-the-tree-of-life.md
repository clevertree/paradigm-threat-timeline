# Saturn's Collinear Planetary Configuration - The Tree of Life

Until the moment of '*creation*', Earth had been hiding like a seedling safely inside Saturn's nurturing "brown dwarf"
system. Then, suddenly and lastingly, there is a catalystic light source that causes life to spring into action.

> Genesis 1:3: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

[Birkeland currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_current)
course through the planets and force them into a new _collinear configuration_, connecting each planet from north to
the South Pole, like an array of batteries. Here is
a [minimalist video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=20&v=KUbD-vYLPAI&feature=emb_title) depicting part of
the collinear configuration. In ["The Saturn Myth"](https://www.everythingselectric.com/product/the-saturn-myth/) David
Talbott describes:

> Accounts of Saturn’s appearance suggest that the planet hung ominously close to the earth.
> In early ritual and astronomy Saturn appears as the primeval sun, described as a figure of terrifying splendour.
> Today, Saturn appears as a bare speck of light following the same visual path as the solar orb.
> But during the legendary Golden Age, Saturn stood in the north.
> Legends from every continent depict the primeval sun as an immense, fiery globe at the
> north celestial pole - the visual pivot of the heavens. Unlike the rising and setting solar orb,
> the primeval sun remained fixed in one place.
