# Jesuits convert native religions to Monotheism

The Jesuits began spreading the [Protestant Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible) around the world
starting with Europe. In assimilating indigenous religions the Jesuits employed a simple They learned all about
the local's belief systems and religious history (if any) focusing on their primary deity, and then claimed that it was
the same entity as Jesus Christ. Every native religion had an origin story that ended with the Earth's Sun becoming
prominent and *chasing away* the older planet gods. The Sun tended to be worshiped as the saviour above all other Gods.
The Jesuits simply convinced the locals that the Sun was the same God they worshiped-Jesus Christ.
The older population accepted additional praise of their saviour, while the younger (more literate) populations understood
something very different-that Jesus was the *Son*of the Monotheistic creator god*Yahweh* i.e. Planet Saturn.

*In the apocalyptic imaginary, the great struggle of Horus is reflected in the enterprise of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, which represent the expansion of the Empire to the four cardinal points, and the Christian cross. After this fight a single God, sovereign, imposes itself and begins the journey of the biblical Egyptian exodus, and that of Troy, according to the mythified ancient history.*
