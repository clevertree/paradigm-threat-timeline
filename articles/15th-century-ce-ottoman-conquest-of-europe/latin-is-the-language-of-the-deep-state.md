# Latin is the Language of the Deep State

If the Deep State was ever to rule the Earth, it must be able to speak the *same language* as its subjects.
Latin is a scientific, authoritarian language with [many rules](https://www.superprof.com/blog/declensions-latin/) and
words that are difficult to pronounce. These rules provide a functional basis
for [translating Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_translations_of_modern_literature) into other
languages, and were designed to supplant indigenous languages into a new
hybridized ["Romance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages#List_of_Romance_languages) language.

If the memory of Rome was a redaction of the Rus-Horde Empire-which never used Latin-then where did the language
come from ? According to 19th century science literature, Latin has always been the primary language used by
a [breakaway civilization](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/cosmos/mars) of humans on Mars. As a result of the Deep State/Martian control over Earth, all of
our sciences-physics, biology, astronomy, even music and religion-are today still written down in the "dead
language" of *Latin*.
