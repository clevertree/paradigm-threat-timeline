![Jews vs Israelites - often on opposite sides of conflicts](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/tartaria/israel_fake_history.jpg?w=384)
*Throughout history, the Jews (those most loyal to the church's authority) and Israelites (those acting in defiance of the church's authority) were often on opposite sides of military and religious conflicts.*

The *Israelites* are defined as a group of people who are
[wrestling against](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-literal-translation-of-Israel-wrestles-with-god-mean)
the *will* of God. Today the term [Israelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites) is redacted with the definition
specifically limited to a race of Semitic-speaking tribes in the middle east, but
in [eastern literature](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05.html) the term refers to the Religious Crusaders of the
Rus-Horde Empire who destroyed Jerusalem \#1 and rebuilt \#2 as
the [Kremlin in Moscow](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html#the609) (circa 1567 CE) in defiance of the Deep
State (a.k.a. God's will). Christ's teachings were seen as blasphemy against the church he was punished with The
Crucifixion. The revenge Crusade that followed was also an act of rebellion against the church. This religious schism
between east and west became a social catalyst that would eventually lead to the rapid creation of a vast Eastern
Tartarian Rus-Horde Empire which was remembered, among many other names, as the **land of Israel**. Throughout history,
the Jews (those most loyal to the church's authority) and Israelites (those acting in defiance of the church's
authority) were often on *opposite sides* of military and religious conflicts.
