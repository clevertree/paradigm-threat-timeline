# Death and Alleged Resurrection

After 6 hours, Christ passed out and was stabbed by a soldier's spear, spilling blood and water from his body.
The body of Christ was removed from
the cross [by his own family](https://www.jesus-story.net/descent/) who brought him into a nearby cave to avoid further mutilation.
The smaller humans, fearing retribution, *did not follow*. At some point in the next 3 days, his family departs for
Crimea [without fanfare or witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_tomb) carrying his body home. There's no reason whatsoever to assume
that the cave was [used for burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_of_Jesus).

However, in the New Testament Christ is then seen alive and healthy by his followers after his death.
How is this possible?
In an [alternate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Jesus) version of the history found in Shingō Japan,
Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead, his brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross,
while Jesus escaped across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan. A sign reads:

![Tomb of Christ in Shingō, Japan - Sawaguchi family residence](https://clevertree.github.io/paradigm-threat-files/history/chronology/christ/tomb_of_christ_and_brother.jpg?w=384)
*Shingō is the location of what is purported to be the resting place of Jesus, the "Tomb of Christ" (Kirisuto no haka), and the residence of Jesus' descendants, the Sawaguchi family.*

> When Jesus Christ was 21 years old, he came to Japan and pursued knowledge of divinity for 12 years.
> He went back to Judea at age 33, and engaged in his mission.
> However at that time people in Judea would not accept Christ's preaching.
> Instead. they arrested him and tried to crucify him on a cross.
> His younger brother Isukiri casually took Christ's place and ended his life on the cross.
> Christ, who escaped the crucifixion went through the ups and downs of travel and again came to Japan.
> He settled right here in what is now called Herai Village, and died at the age of 106.
> On this holy ground. there is dedicated a burial mound on the right to deify Christ, and a grave on the left to deity Isukiri.
>
> The above description was given in a testament by Jesus Christ.


In this story, Christ's brother died in his place. It is entirely plausible that the smaller human crowd couldn't tell
the difference between two ugly giants, or didn't care. Either way, this alternate history is also reflected in the
founding of 'ancient Rome' by Romulus (i.e. Christ) and Remus (i.e. John the Baptist) where one brother kills another
in order to create an Empire.
Fomenko demonstrates how this event became duplicated by historians of the Reformation;
113 reflections of [Andronicus-Christ](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_18.html),
59 reflections of [Virgin Mary](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_19.html),
39 reflections of [John the Baptist](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_20.html),
and 61 reflections of [Judas Iscariot](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_20.html).


After the Crucifixion, Christ was
[seen many times](https://rsc.byu.edu/jerusalem-zarahemla/when-did-jesus-visit-americas)
in Asia and America.
The Monotheist (Pharisees) who defeated Christ didn't realize that the revolution he started would be continued by
his surviving brother. In fact, it is likely that before Christ, the martyring of popular revolutionary figures
always had the same effect - causing the permanent defeat of the revolution. Instead, the success of Christ's martyrdom
may be a result of multiple unique circumstances.

With the act of crucifying Christ, the Church had
declared far and wide that he was **not the messiah** nor the King of the Jews. Ironically, the idea sprung into the
medieval mind - that Christ **was actually the messiah** but had been denied by the Jews. To make things worse for the
Church's authority, the locals started comparing Christ to the 2nd savior of Earth - planet Jupiter. In the legend, king
Jupiter (i.e. King Arthur, Zeus etc.) "dies" during the dark ages, disappearing into a cave (the Absu layer), and
reemerging after 2.5 days to once again sit on a throne of plasma discharge and be crowned with the sun's light. The
Church's crucifixion had backfired creating their worst nightmare - a human Savior of *eastern* bloodlines worshiped as
a god by the west. Oops!
