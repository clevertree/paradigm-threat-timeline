# Timeline synchronization

As a result of the
deliberate [destruction and obfuscation of indigenous culture worldwide](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-resistance-new-colonialism)
by the Holy Roman Empire, we have an array of conflicting dates of common events. Some examples of different dates of
*"Creation"* are:

- **5969 B.C.** — Antiochian by [Theophilus](https://biblehub.com/library/theophilus/theophilus_to_autolycus/chapter_xxiv_chronology_from_adam.htm) (*To Autolycus* III)
- **5872 B.C.** — [Dating of the seventy interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) (Septuagint tradition)
- **5515 B.C.** — by [Theophilus](https://biblehub.com/library/theophilus/theophilus_to_autolycus/chapter_xxiv_chronology_from_adam.htm) (also 5507)
- **5508 B.C.** — [Byzantine dating](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Byzantine_Creation_Era) a.k.a. "The Constantinople version"

- **4700 B.C.** — [Samaritan](https://www.bible.ca/manuscripts/Samaritan-Chronicle-book-of-Joshua-Chronology-Genesis5-Textual-variants-Bible-manuscripts-Old-Testament-Torah-Tanakh-creation-4263BC-age-earth-1362AD.htm) (see investigation for discrepancy)
- **4004 B.C.** — [Hebraic dating by Ussher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussher_chronology)
- **3761 B.C.** — [Judaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Jewish_chronology) (Jewish calendar)
- **3491 B.C.** — by Hieronymus ([not found in standard Jerome chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome); see [creation-dates validation](../../investigations/creation-dates-validation.md))
- **August 11, 3114 B.C.** — [Maya (Long Count)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar)
- **3102 B.C. (Feb 17/18)** — [Hindu (Kali Yuga)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga)
- **c. 3000 B.C.** — [Egyptian (unification / Early Dynastic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_chronology)
- **c. 2070 B.C.** — [Chinese (Xia dynasty)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia%E2%80%93Shang%E2%80%93Zhou_Chronology_Project) / traditional chronology
- **Sumerian / Mesopotamian** — [Eridu Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu_Genesis), [Sumerian creation myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_creation_myth) (no single creation year; written tradition c. 1600 B.C.)
- **Zoroastrian** — [Zoroastrian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrian_calendar) (epoch varies by tradition)

Detailed validation and primary sources for the list above are in [creation-dates validation](../../investigations/creation-dates-validation.md).

This project's starting point was the [reconstructed timeline](https://saturniancosmology.org/short.htm) of events
by [Jno Cook's](https://jnocook.net/) starting with a creation date
of [4077 B.C](https://saturniancosmology.org/rec.php#rec-c25h)
which is based on
the [Quiche Maya](https://www.ancient.eu/article/414/maya-religion-the-light-that-came-from-beside-the/). His
book [Recovering the Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Lost-World-Jno-Cook/dp/0997237910)
provides a reconstruction of events based on indigenous records which re-interpret Earth's *Origin Story* in the words
of our ancestors who _were alive when it all happened_.

*[The Electric Universe Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Universe-Wallace-Thornhill/dp/B007SP1LK8) posits that galaxies, stars (including our Sun), and comets can be best understood through the well-tested behavior of electricity—the one force about which astronomers seem to know almost nothing, a force that is 10^36 or more times as strong as gravity.*
