# The length of a Year changes throughout Antiquity

The Earth's Orbit changed over time from the [collinear configuration](https://chipstero7.wordpress.com/) (Golden Age),
to the non-linear configuration dominated by Jupiter (Dark ages), and into its final orbit in modern times.
With each *jump*, the number of days in a calendar year changed dramatically.
