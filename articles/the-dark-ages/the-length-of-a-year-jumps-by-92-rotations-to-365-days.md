# The length of a year jumps by 92 rotations to 365 days

Based on the increase in the number of days (+92) in a year, we can ascertain that Earth has finally left Jupiter's
orbit and is on an independent orbit around the Sun. The _newly independent_ inner planets begin to form final
electro-magnetic fields. Full exposure to the Sun causes the Earth to become covered in obscuring clouds and a plague
of darkness lasting 20 years.
In [Worlds in Collision](https://books.google.com/books?id=FJst27kSVBgC&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=When+Venus+sprang+out+of+Jupiter+as+a+comet)
, Immanuel Velikovsky describes other plagues like frogs and locusts:

> When Venus sprang out of Jupiter as a comet and flew very close to the earth, it became
> entangled in the embrace of the earth. The internal heat developed by the earth and the scorching
> gases of the comet were in themselves sufficient to make the vermin of the earth propagate at a
> very feverish rate. Some of the plagues, like the plague of the frogs ("the land brought forth
> frogs") or of the locusts, must be ascribed to such causes. Anyone who has experienced a
> khamsin (sirocco), an electrically charged wind blowing from the desert,
> knows how, during the few days that the wind blows, the ground around the villages begins to
> teem with vermin.
