# The length of a year increases by 20 rotations to 260 days.

The cataclysmic contact with Venus ends as "_Messiah_" Jupiter re-appears through the fading Absu. Jupiter, apparently
risen from the dead after 2.5 days, once again appears upon its coma-tail mountain (or throne). This "resurrection"
seemed to have the effect of calming the destructive rage of Venus, and She returned to spherical form. Earth's orbit
around Jupiter changes slightly resulting in a _260-day year_ and Earth manages to **capture The Moon**, which becomes
visible for the first time. With the Absu significantly reduced, stars were also visible in the southern hemisphere for
the first time.
