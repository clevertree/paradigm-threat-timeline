# Humanity was then cast out of the Garden of Eden

From humanity's perspective, they couldn't contemplate why their _creator_ (planet Saturn)
had tossed them out of its Garden (the collinear configuration)
changing their world for the worse. They search for answers to simple questions:
_Why don't the trees produce fruit anymore? Why can't women have babies anymore? Why are the animals eating each other?_

Finding no simple answers, the priests of the fallen Atlantis offer their fellow survivors on Earth a rather ominous
explanation:
__The creator (Saturn) was punishing its creation (humanity) for our choice to seek forbidden knowledge__. This lie
functions to coalesce some humans under the influence of the **Deep State**. Humans were then ordered to erect graven
images of the "Bull of Heaven"
and sacrifice the weakest of the brood to it, in order to convince the fictional
deity [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch)
to restore the "Golden Age". The _Human Sacrifice_ became a central policy of the **Deep State**
as families were ordered
to [conscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ancient_Egypt#Old_and_Middle_Kingdom_armies) their children
into war,
[re-educate](http://www.legendsandchronicles.com/ancient-civilizations/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-education/) them,
or sell them into [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Egypt#Bonded_laborers).
