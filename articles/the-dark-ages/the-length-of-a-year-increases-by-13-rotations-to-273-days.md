# The length of a year increases by 13 rotations to 273 days.

At the same time, northern populations of the Earth experienced an ice-age lasting well over 200 years.
In [Egyptian Myth and Catastrophism](http://firmament-chaos.com/papers/EgyptianarticleV2.pdf) Robert Ackerman explains:

> It is of interest that mythologies of countries where the fiery-dragon (proto-Venus)
> cannot be correlated with heat or drought, such as the Norse, preserve it as a representative of winter.
> This can be explained in the catastrophism scenario by the fact that during the Vedic Period, Proto-Venus,
> still sporting its comet-like tail, came closest to the Earth at the time of the release of
> priori-Mars from geosynchronous orbit. On those occasions the mantle of the Earth would return to
> its normal rotation about the North Pole, at which position the Norse lands would be much farther
> from the equator than when priori-Mars orbited the Earth.
