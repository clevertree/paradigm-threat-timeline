# How many Lunar Months are in a Year?

1 month was the period of 28 days of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, and back then there were *13 months* of 28
days in a year with the addition of one leap day. Over time, the period of Earth's orbit around the Sun changed
slightly, causing less than 13 lunar months to occur 63 years per century. This caused a conflict in religious ceremonies
where some holidays would be skipped in some years, leading to the number 13 being
considered [unlucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_\(number\)#Bad).

The Deep State, which was seeking to control this
new Astrological religion, took advantage of the calendar conflict by inventing the Zodiac and 12 month
Roman/Julian/Gregorian Calendar. This gave the Deep State churches authority over religious ceremony, farming, and even
governance/warfare. The Deep State leveraged their new Zodiac religion as a buffer between the old testament secrets they wished to
keep, and the religious texts propagated to the masses. The life stories they published in the modern bible about the
*resurrected Jesus Christ* are all redactions of
[stories](https://solarmythology.com/lessons/christ2002.htm) based on the Sun and seasons on a 12-month calendar.
Similarly, the stories published in the OT about King David
are [also redactions](https://www.usbible.com/Astrology/stars_of_david.htm) based on the 12 Zodiac signs.
