# The length of a year increases by an additional 15 rotations per year to 240 days total.

The Maya calendar starts with Earth jumping into its *second orbit* under Jupiter's influence
on [3114 B.C.E.](https://www.aaas.org/myths-mayan-long-count-calendar#:~:text=The%20Long%20Count%20is%20an,6%20in%20the%20Julian%20calendar)
with each year (orbit around the Sun) recorded as 240 days long. This would be the first time humanity got a peak at our
Sun and gas-giant Jupiter, which were hiding behind Saturn until now. This new Sun would prove to be too bright for most
to bear and life on earth escaped into dark caves to avoid it. Occasionally Jupiter would orbit in front of the Sun, and
together they would appear as a radiant throne in the sky.

> And the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
> their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty
> men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
> And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and
> from the wrath of the Lamb:
> For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
