# Timeline Update: Author Profiles, Third Story, Core Concepts, and Major Restructure

*February 26, 2026 — Paradigm Threat*

---

A full structural overhaul and a significant batch of new content. This entry covers everything since yesterday: 24 individual author profile pages replacing a single list article, a new overview article on Talbott's Third Story thesis, a falsifiability framework for the project's core claims, a new article on physics challenges (SAFIRE, electric fossilization), content reorganized into chapter subfolders, and multiple numbering refactors.

## 24 Individual Author Profile Articles (Section 15)

The single background article that previously listed all catastrophist authors in one file has been broken into **24 individual author profiles**, each with its own content file, events.json entry, and media image. These now occupy **Section 15** (Author Profiles), with the Credits article moved to Section 16.

Profiles added or split out in this session:

- **Immanuel Velikovsky** — the suppressed catastrophist; *Worlds in Collision* (1950); the Venus-as-comet thesis and the Velikovsky Affair
- **Anatoly Fomenko** — mathematician; founder of New Chronology; statistical analysis of textual echoes showing the historical record is ~1000 years shorter than accepted
- **David Talbott** — founder of The Thunderbolts Project; the Saturn-Earth capture model; *Thunderbolts of the Gods*; EU2012 keynote on the Third Story
- **Anthony Peratt** — Los Alamos plasma physicist; high-energy discharge morphology and petroglyphs; lightning mapping and the squatting-man figure
- **Heribert Illig** — Phantom Time Hypothesis; argued that 297 years (AD 614–911) were inserted into the historical record by Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII
- **Gunnar Heinsohn** — stratigraphic chronologist; argued that three parallel strata (Late Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman) represent the same single layer from the 10th–11th centuries CE
- **Dwardu Cardona** — plasma mythologist; extended the Saturn polar configuration model through dozens of conference papers and six book volumes
- **Ev Cochrane** — comparative mythologist; Mars as the warrior archetype; *The Many Faces of Venus* and *Martian Metamorphoses*
- **Clube & Napier** — astronomers; the Coherent Catastrophism model; cometary fragmentation and the Taurid meteor stream as the historical engine of Bronze Age collapse
- **Alfred de Grazia** — quantavolutionary theorist; psychologist and political scientist who applied catastrophism to human behavioral history; *Quantavolution* series
- **Jno Cook** — the most comprehensively cited synthesizer of the Saturnian chronology; correlated Vedic, Mesoamerican, Egyptian, and Chinese sources in exhaustive parallel
- **Tom Van Flandern** — astronomer; the Exploded Planet Hypothesis; argued that the asteroid belt is the remnant of a destroyed planet rather than an unformed one
- **Robert Schoch** — geologist and Egyptologist; redating the Sphinx to at least 7,000 BC based on water erosion patterns; erosion from precipitation before the desertification of North Africa
- **Graham Hancock** — journalist and investigative researcher; *Fingerprints of the Gods* (1995); the case for a pre-Ice Age civilization destroyed in a global cataclysm
- **Michael Cremo** — researcher; *Forbidden Archaeology* (1993); evidence for human presence millions of years earlier than the standard model permits
- **de Santillana & von Dechend** — *Hamlet's Mill* (1969); the thesis that world mythology preserved precise astronomical observations of precession encoded in narrative form
- **Donald Scott** — electrical engineer; *The Electric Sky* (2006); simplest formal introduction to the Electric Sun model with engineering-grade derivations
- **Livio Stecchini** — metrologist; ancient metrology and the precision of the Great Pyramid; argued that Egyptian geometry encoded a sophisticated geodetic survey of the Earth
- **Rose & Vaughan** — researchers; the 260-day Tzolkin as a Mars orbital calendar, not an arbitrary invention; the calendar year as a physical record of orbital mechanics
- **Martinus van der Sluijs** — mythologist and plasma researcher; the polar configuration and global aurora mythology; *Traditional Cosmology* series
- **Charles Ginenthal** — science historian; *Carl Sagan and Immanuel Velikovsky* (1995); comprehensive rebuttal of the mainstream dismissal of catastrophism
- **Jno Cook, Donald Scott, Ev Cochrane, Alfred de Grazia** — reordered in section 15 to follow Anthony Peratt in what is now the canonical DFS sequence

Profile images (portraits or representative illustrations) have been added for **nine** of these authors. Author image paths were consolidated under `media/15-author-profiles/`.

## New Article: The Third Story (00.01.00)

**David Talbott's EU2012 keynote** — *"The Human Story"* (Thunderbolts Project, Phoenix, AZ) — has been written up as the new opening article of the overview section, positioned at `00.01.00`.

The article reconstructs Talbott's central argument: all of human intellectual history has been a contest between two stories — mythology and religion on one side, rational science on the other — and that *both* stories are incomplete because neither can account for the other. The third story is the reconstruction: ancient myth is literal astronomy, the gods are planets, and the sky was violently different in recorded human memory.

Key topics covered:

- **Why the two dominant stories are both incomplete** — myth contains specific astronomical details inexplicable by the current sky; science discards the entire pre-rational record as primitive fantasy
- **Cross-cultural convergence as evidence** — hundreds of independent mythic archetypes (the World Mountain, the Golden Age, the Divine Warrior, the Dragon in the sky, the Wheel of Heaven) are too specific and too globally consistent to be coincidence
- **Saturn as the original Sun** — the Babylonian *Shamash*, the Greek *Helios*, and the Latin *Sol* all referred in earliest usage to Saturn, not the current Sun; every scholar acknowledges the identification, and none explain why
- **Venus as the great comet** — the universal mythological attributes of Venus (flowing hair, feathered serpent, fire-breathing, serpentine form) are the attributes of a plasma-dischargning comet, not a featureless dot of light in the evening sky
- **Mars as the warrior** — the warrior god's weapon across all cultures (vajra, dorje, kongo, thunderbolt, Mjölnir, Indra's bolt) is a bipolar plasma discharge form reproducible in laboratory plasma experiments; the warrior god *is* his weapon
- **The Saturn-Earth polar configuration** — planets collinearly aligned above the pole, stable long enough to enter human cultural memory as the permanent archaic sky, then catastrophically disrupted

## New Article: Challenging Established Physics (00.02.03)

A new background article has been added at `00.02.03`, surveying experimental and observational evidence that contradicts the foundational assumptions of mainstream physics, geology, and cosmology. Three threads are covered in depth:

### The SAFIRE Project

**Montgomery Childs** designed SAFIRE (Stellar Atmospheric Function In Regulation Experiment, 2012) explicitly as a falsification test of the Electric Sun model — if the plasma lab does not behave like a miniature sun, the model is wrong. It behaved like a miniature sun.

Results across three experimental phases:
- Plasma spontaneously self-organized into a **rhythmic heartbeat** pattern (not predicted by the Standard Solar Model)
- **Energy densities matching the solar photosphere** achieved with no internal fuel
- **Transmutation of elements** confirmed via mass spectroscopy — new elements not present in the original anode appeared after experimental runs, consistent with cold plasma fusion
- **Net energy gain** — the reactor produces more energy than it consumes, drawing on an external source consistent with the EU prediction of galactic-scale current delivery

**Aureon Energy Ltd.** was incorporated to commercialize the results. The article notes that the Standard Solar Model cannot accommodate these findings — a gravity-driven thermonuclear sun cannot be miniaturized into a bell jar; an electrically-powered anode can.

### Electric Fossilization (Peter Mungo Jupp)

Australian archaeologist **Peter Mungo Jupp** documented the experimental proof: when high-voltage transmission wire accidentally contacted live tree roots in Alberta, every root that touched the wire was converted from wet woody tissue to **pure silica** in a matter of hours. **Wal Thornhill** reproduced the principle at EU2017 by producing fulgurites via direct discharge into sand.

The article also covers the chemical pathway: Russian studies confirm neutrons are propagated during lightning discharges; the addition of neutrons to water molecules under massive current provides a physically plausible transmutation route from H₂O → CaCO₃ (water → limestone), accounting for marine organisms preserved inside solid rock with no intervening burial or compression event.

This section contextualizes the **1774 CE petrification event** (Chapter 12) as a planetary-scale instance of the same process SAFIRE demonstrates in a bell jar.

## Core Concepts: Eight Falsifiable Propositions (00.03.00)

The Core Concepts article has been substantially rewritten. It now opens the section with an explicit **falsifiability framework** — eight propositions, each stated without qualification, each followed by a statement of what falsifying it would destroy in the project.

The eight propositions:
1. Saturn was Earth's original polar companion (before 4,077 BC)
2. Earth's orbital year length changed in discrete quantized steps
3. The Solar System operates on electromagnetic, not purely gravitational, physics
4. Ancient mythology is literal astronomical testimony
5. Multiple catastrophic global events occurred within the human record
6. Conventional dating methods require recalibration for a variable-year past
7. The conventional historical timeline has been artificially extended
8. (covered in the article)

The article explicitly applies the same evidential standard the SAFIRE Project applied to the Electric Sun model: empirical observation, physical replicability, no interpretive exceptions. If any single proposition is false, the project fails — and that is stated in the article.

## Content Reorganized Into Chapter Subfolders

All content files have been moved from a flat `content/` directory into **chapter-specific subfolders** matching the `media/` directory layout:

- `content/00.overview/` — overview and background articles
- `content/01.before-creation/` — Chapter 01
- `content/02.the-golden-age/` — Chapter 02
- `content/03.the-dark-ages/` — Chapter 03
- … and so on through Chapter 15

This makes the directory structure self-documenting and consistent: media images and content articles for a given chapter now live in parallel-named folders at their respective levels.

## Overview Section Renumbered

The `00.overview` section has been renumbered to accommodate the new Third Story article and the Core Concepts section:

| Old number | New number | Title |
|---|---|---|
| (new) | `00.01.00` | The Third Story |
| `00.01.00` | `00.02.00` | Background |
| `00.01.01`–`00.01.03` | `00.02.01`–`00.02.03` | Background children |
| `00.02.00` | `00.03.00` | Core Concepts |
| `00.02.01`–`00.02.03` | `00.03.01`–`00.03.03` | Core Concepts children |

Cross-links within all affected articles have been updated.
