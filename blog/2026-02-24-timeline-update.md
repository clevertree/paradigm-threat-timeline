# Timeline Update: Atlantis Investigation, Joan of Arc, and the Absu

*February 24, 2026 — Paradigm Threat*

Two days after launch, the investigation is already moving. Here is a summary of what has been added or changed since the initial release.

## Atlantis Article Significantly Expanded

The article on **Atlantis and the Tree of Knowledge** received a major research pass. The key addition is a new section — *Plato's Description Cannot Be Located on Earth* — which works directly through the source text of *Timaeus* and *Critias* to make the case that Plato was not describing a location that can be found on today's planet.

The specific quotes we are working with:

- **Timaeus 24e–25a**: the island described is *larger than Libya and Asia combined* — not a geographic region that fits anywhere in the present Atlantic
- **Critias 113e–114a**: "ships and voyages were not yet" — the founding of Atlantis is placed explicitly before maritime civilization, which in the Saturnian model corresponds to the polar configuration era, not any historical Mediterranean period
- **Critias 118b–c**: the plain is described as sheltered from the north winds, oriented toward the south — consistent with the polar axis configuration rather than a mid-Atlantic island
- **Critias 111–112**: the land was reshaped by repeated catastrophe, and what Plato describes bears no resemblance to any remaining geography

This section contextualizes the three Atlantean city names — **Og**, **Aryan**, and **Poseida** — which have been moved to a dedicated closing section. The sourcing on these names is genuinely mixed: Og traces to the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q531, Book of Giants) and the biblical Og of Bashan; Aryan appears in Blavatsky's *Secret Doctrine* (1888) as a root-race designator; Poseida is documented in the Edgar Cayce A.R.E. readings (series 364, 1923–1944) and the Tyberonn channelings. The investigation notes that the Ahnenerbe's Atlantis research was heavily suppressed during the 1945–1951 denazification period, which complicates any attempt to distinguish legitimate pre-war findings from fabrication — and is documented as such rather than written off.

## Joan of Arc Repositioned and Rewritten

The Joan of Arc event has been moved from an earlier period into the **16th-century Reformation and Inquisition** section, consistent with Fomenko's reconstruction in *History: Fiction or Science?* chapter 6, paragraphs 30–31.

Under that reconstruction:

- **Jeanne d'Arc = the biblical Deborah** (judge and military leader of Israel)
- **Gilles de Rais = Samson** (the companion whose fall mirrors the Samson and Delilah narrative, including the betrayal and the burning)
- **The Inquisition proceedings = the Book of Judges**

The article now works through these parallels directly, with citations to Fomenko's statistical analysis of the textual overlap. A new illustration accompanies the entry.

## Last Sprinkling of Absu Dust — New Article

A full article has been added for the event tentatively dated to approximately **1200 CE**: the final observed dispersion of Absu material — the plasma sheath that had surrounded Saturn during the Golden Age and continued to shed particulate debris into Earth's upper atmosphere for centuries after the polar configuration collapsed.

The article covers:

- The Raspil (spray/spattering) events documented in medieval sources as anomalous sky phenomena
- The Uoroboros timeline — the serpent-eating-its-tail motif as a marker of cyclical Absu dispersal events
- The connection to the global **Mud Flood** evidence: a worldwide sediment layer that may correspond to the final Absu deposition event, not a single catastrophe but a cumulative process with a distinct terminus

This article was previously slotted in the **11.x** range and has been repositioned into the **12.x** (18th-century) block following a structural reorganization of the late articles. Several other entries in that range were also renumbered for internal consistency.

## Carbon-14 Spike Repositioned

The article on the Carbon-14 spike event has been moved from **03.190** (Late Bronze Age) to **11.265**, recognizing that the primary spike evidence aligns better with the medieval catastrophe period. This is a significant chronological reattribution — the spike long assumed to mark a Bronze Age cosmic event may instead be recording something that happened in what the Scaligerian calendar calls the 13th or 14th century CE.

## PDF Export Now Live

The downloadable PDF version of the timeline is now available, generated directly from the article content. It includes:

- A dedicated title page with version stamp
- A full Table of Contents linked to all article headings
- All narrative content rendered cleanly without interactive elements

The PDF is regenerated on each commit and versioned with the repository. The current version is **1.0.21**.

## Ongoing Fixes

- Year reckoning corrected: the Golden Age start is now consistently pegged at **4077 BCE** across all articles and the introduction
- All content files audited for present-tense verbs and corrected to past tense (Fomenko-style scholarly past tense throughout)
- Four broken media links in `events.json` repaired — images now reference correct file paths confirmed against the article markdown sources
- Introduction updated with new images; the project-objective section removed in favor of the live timeline link
- Cross-reference links added between related articles to reduce repeated exposition
