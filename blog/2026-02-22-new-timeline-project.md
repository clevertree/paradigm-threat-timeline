# A Dedicated Timeline for Earth's Hidden History

*February 22, 2026 — Paradigm Threat*

---

After years of research, writing, and community building, we are proud to announce the launch of the **Paradigm Threat Timeline** — a dedicated, interactive timeline project for reconstructing and visualizing Earth's suppressed and alternative history.

You can explore it now at **[paradigmthreat.net/timeline](https://paradigmthreat.net/timeline)**.

## What's New

Paradigm Threat has always featured timeline-style content, but it was spread across articles and lists with no unified way to navigate or visualize the full scope of the material. That changes today.

The new timeline gives us:

- **A structured event database** covering all major chronological systems — Scaligerian, Fomenko's New Chronology, Saturnian Cosmology, Phantom Time, Byzantine, Judaic, Hindu, Maya, and indigenous traditions — with every event carrying multiple dates from multiple sources
- **Interactive visualization** so readers can see how events from different chronologies relate, overlap, and contradict each other
- **Fomenko duplicate tracking** — events identified as phantom duplicates are linked, so you can trace how medieval scribes copied or fabricated ancient history
- **Investigation articles** for contested claims, with primary source citations and explicit notes where sources cannot be verified or may have been redacted
- **Dedicated article pages** for each event and topic, combining narrative writing with the rigorous citation standards the investigation demands

This is not a textbook. It is an ongoing investigation into who wrote history, when they wrote it, and why.

## AI-Assisted Research at New Speed

A significant part of what made this launch possible is the integration of AI agents into the research workflow.

We are now running high-quality, rapid research against primary and mirror sources including:

- **[chronologia.org](https://chronologia.org)** — Anatoly Fomenko and Gleb Nosovsky's New Chronology research, including statistical analysis of historical texts and dynastic parallels
- **[saturniancosmology.org](https://saturniancosmology.org)** — Jno Cook's monumental *Recovering the Lost World*, a 700,000-word reconstruction of Earth's catastrophic prehistory from global indigenous sources
- **[mythsarehistory.com](https://mythsarehistory.com)** — cross-cultural myth analysis connecting ancient narratives to real astronomical and geological events

AI agents are being used to read, summarize, cross-reference, and generate structured event entries from these sources at a pace that would take years by hand. Every entry is reviewed and the methodology remains transparent — where AI infers, it documents the inference; where a source cannot be found, the gap is recorded rather than papered over.

The investigation is now moving at a genuinely new speed.

## Thank You to Our Sponsors and Supporters

This project would not exist without the people who believed in it through years of development — long before it had a dedicated page or a proper interface.

To **everyone who donated, subscribed, shared articles, sent research tips, corrected errors, or simply stayed curious**: thank you. You kept this going through platform censorship, hosting migrations, and the long stretches when progress was invisible.

To the **researchers whose work forms the foundation** of this timeline — Jno Cook, Anatoly Fomenko, Gleb Nosovsky, David Talbott, Wal Thornhill, Immanuel Velikovsky, and the many independent investigators working in their tradition — your decades of work made this synthesis possible.

Special thanks to the **early supporters of the Paradigm Threat project** who funded the infrastructure, encouraged the pivot from a single-article format to a full research platform, and pushed us to build something worthy of the material.

## What Comes Next

The timeline is live but the investigation never stops. Upcoming work includes:

- More entries from **Fomenko's dynastic parallelism** — the statistical argument that "ancient" history is a phantom reflection of medieval events
- The **Mu and Atlantis question** — are these mythologized memories of the pre-flood world, or later inventions?
- Deeper integration of **indigenous oral histories** as primary sources, not footnotes

Come and investigate with us.
